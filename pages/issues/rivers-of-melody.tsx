        <h2>How Rivers Made America and Americans Made Music</h2>

        Perhaps no other feature of the American landscape figures so
        prominently in popular song as its rivers. Collectively, American river
        songs not only serve as a compendium of American history and folklore,
        but as a continuously developing account of American popular music. From
        the earliest days of the republic, through the 19th century and into the
        20th, various occupational groups inspired a wide variety of songs
        dealing with the pleasures, as well as the dangers and labor-related
        aspects of life on the river.
      </p>
      America has more than 250,000 rivers &ndash; over 3 million miles &ndash;
      dissecting the fields, cities, and forests of the nation. These
      aren&rsquo;t just any rivers; these are world-class rivers. The
      Mississippi watershed alone drains the rain and snow that falls on over a
      million square miles, generating 390 billion gallons of water per day.
      <br />
      Rivers have shaped the basic facts of America. Many state borders were set
      by rivers. The Rio Grande separates the United States from Mexico. Sixteen
      states were named after rivers, along with over 150 counties. Rivers have
      also shaped where we live. When colonists arrived on the Eastern shores of
      America, they established their farms and settlements in the coastal
      plain, where the land was flat and the rivers, streams, and sloughs were
      easily plied. As time went on, and more settlers arrived, people moved
      farther inland. There, they were confronted by the Fall Line, where the
      Atlantic coastal plain runs up against the Piedmont. Upstream of the Fall
      Line, rivers run through narrow, steep-walled valleys interspersed with
      rapids. Downstream on the coastal plain, the rivers are easily traveled.
      For anyone to move a bale of cotton or a bushel of wheat from the interior
      by boat, the Fall Line would mark the end of the line. There, canoes
      moving downstream would have to be unloaded, portaged around the obstacle,
      and reloaded. To move goods upstream from the Atlantic, cargo would have
      to be shifted from larger coastal or ocean-going vessels to land
      transportation, canoes, or rafts to transport beyond the Fall Line.

        The Fall River in the title of this song refers to the town of Fall
        River, Massachusetts, which was originally settled in 1653 as Freetown.
        In 1803, Fall River separated from Freetown and was officially
        incorporated &quot;The <strong>Fall River Line</strong>
        was a combination steamboat and railroad connection between New York
        City and Boston that operated between 1847 and 1937. It consisted of a
        railroad journey between Boston and Fall River, Massachusetts, where
        passengers would then board steamboats for the journey through
        Narragansett Bay and Long Island Sound to the line's own Hudson River
        dock in Manhattan. For many years, it was the preferred route to take
        for travel between the two major cities. The line was extremely popular,
        and its steamboats were some of the most advanced and luxurious of their
        day&quot;.(Wikipedia) Listen to the{" "}

        At the Fall Line ports of the 18th century, villages and towns began
        forming and growing. These otherwise random places at the intersection
        of rivers and the Fall Line became natural places for people to settle
        and for towns to grow &ndash; Richmond on the James, Washington on the
        Potomac, Trenton on the Delaware, and nearly all of the other major
        cities of the eastern U.S. But, cities of the Midwest, the Deep South,
        and the Far West are much the same. Many cities lie at the junction of
        important rivers &ndash; Pittsburgh, where the Monongahela and Allegheny
        join to form the Ohio; Kansas City at the junction of the Missouri and
        Kansas rivers; and Sacramento at the Sacramento and American rivers.
        Cities of the Deep South are typically situated to avoid water, or at
        least floods. Memphis, Vicksburg, and Natchez all sit upon a bluff
        overlooking the Mississippi. They&rsquo;re at a safe elevation, yet
        close enough to the river to be bustling ports for 19th century
        steamboats and 21st century barge tows. Where rivers are constricted to
        narrow valleys and canyons, or where they cascade over waterfalls, their
        physical power has been harnessed through evolving technology. Settlers
        of the 18th and 19th centuries built their villages around small dams
        which powered waterwheels. 20th century engineers built massive concrete
        dams and turbines to generate power that would be sent through an
        ever-growing electric grid to distant cities. Rivers have also shaped
        the very ideas of what America should be. Which level of government
        should regulate commerce? River-borne commerce on interstate rivers
        drove the new republic to have a single, national economy rather than a
        collection of independent state economies. How big should the nation be?
        The Louisiana Purchase changed the geography of America. Acquiring the
        entire Missouri River basin added a vast western empire and it became
        &ldquo;manifest destiny&rdquo; to explore and settle it. As author
        Martin Doyle explains in his book The Source, &ldquo;just as European
        powers had competed to cross the barrier of the Atlantic quickest and
        most efficiently to establish the hub of commerce, a geographic
        competition between those based along the Potomac, the Hudson, and the
        Mississippi was under way for access to the Ohio River.&rdquo;(1) Thomas
        Jefferson realized that the links (rivers) to the western country was
        key to commercial expansion of the new republic. He said that
        &ldquo;there would be a rivalship between the Hudson [in the North] and
        the Potomac [in the South] for the residue of the commerce of all the
        country westward of Lake Erie.&rdquo;(2) But, in 1784 the United States
        was governed by the Articles of Confederation, with each state
        functioning independently. The Potomac forms part of the border between
        Maryland and Virginia. Getting Congress to come to an agreement between
        those states for work on an interstate river would be like establishing
        a treaty between the United States and Mexico over the Rio Grande. In
        1785, delegates from those states met at George Washington&rsquo;s home
        at Mount Vernon. There, they worked out an arrangement, the Mount Vernon
        Compact, for commerce on the river. James Madison of Virginia suggested
        another meeting on interstate commerce and inviting representatives from
        all the states. In September 1786, that conference was held in
        Annapolis, MD. It was soon realized that the Articles of Confederation
        imposed numerous obstacles to any agreement, not the least of which was
        that everything had to be agreed upon unanimously. Given the rivalry
        between North and South, even at this early date, unanimity was almost
        impossible. Madison and the other delegates decided on still another
        meeting, in Philadelphia in 1787. While interstate commerce was its
        initial purpose, this final meeting ultimately resulted in our present
        Constitution. So, rivers can be said to have been so important that the
        very founding of the United States was the result.{" "}

        &quot;The <strong>Wabash River</strong> is a 503-mile-long river in the
        Midwestern United States that flows southwest from near the Indiana
        border in northwest Ohio, across northern and central Indiana to
        southern Illinois, where it forms the Illinois-Indiana border before
        draining into the Ohio River, of which it is the largest northern
        tributary. From the dam near Huntington, Indiana, to its terminus at the
        Ohio River, the Wabash flows freely for 411 miles (661 km). Its
        watershed drains most of Indiana. The Wabash is the state river of
        Indiana, and subject of the state song "On the Banks of the Wabash, Far
        Away" by Paul Dresser. Two counties (in Indiana and Illinois), eight
        townships in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio; one Illinois precinct, one
        city, one town, two colleges, one high school, one canal, one former
        class I railroad, several bridges and avenues are all named for the
        river itself while four US Navy warships are either named for the river
        or the numerous battles that took place on or near it.&quot; (Wikipedia)

        The <strong>Ohio River</strong>, which streams westward from Pittsburgh,
        Pennsylvania, to Cairo, Illinois, is the largest tributary, by volume,
        of the Mississippi River. At the confluence, the Ohio is considerably
        bigger than the Mississippi and is hydrologically the main stream of the
        whole river system. The 981-mile (1,579 km) river flows through or along
        the border of six states, and its drainage basin includes parts of 15
        states. Through its largest tributary, the Tennessee River, the basin
        includes many of the states of the southeastern U.S. It is the source of
        drinking water for (more than) three million people. The name "Ohio"
        comes from the Seneca Indian,
        <em>Ohi:yo'</em>, "Good River". The river had great significance in the
        history of the Native Americans, as numerous civilizations formed along
        its valley. For thousands of years, Native Americans used the river as a
        major transportation and trading route. Listen to the{" "}

        The <strong>Suwannee River</strong> (also spelled
        <strong> Suwanee River</strong>) is a major river that runs through
        South Georgia southward into Florida in the southern United States. It
        is a wild blackwater river, about 246 miles long. The Suwannee River is
        the site of the prehistoric Suwanee Straits which separated peninsular
        Florida from the panhandle. This river is the subject of the Stephen
        Foster song "Old Folks at Home", in which he calls it the
        <strong>Swanee Ribber</strong>. Foster had named the Pedee River of
        South Carolina in his first lyrics. It has been called{" "}
        <strong>Swanee River</strong> because Foster had used an alternative
        contemporary spelling of the name.(see below for more on &quot;Swanee
        Ribber). George Gershwin's song, made popular by Al Jolson, is also
        spelled "Swanee" and boasts that "the folks up North will see me no more
        when I get to that Swanee shore". Both of these songs feature
        banjo-strumming and reminiscences of a plantation life more typical of
        19th-century South Carolina than of among the swamps and small farms in
        the coastal plain of south Georgia and north Florida. Listen to the

        "<strong>Old Folks at Home</strong>" (also known as "
        <strong>Swanee River</strong>", "<strong>Swanee Ribber</strong>" [from
        the original lyrics], or "<strong>Suwannee River</strong>") is a
        minstrel song written by Stephen Foster in 1851. Since 1935 it has been
        the official state song of Florida, although in 2008 the original lyrics
        were changed due to political correctness concerns. According to Joel
        Whitburn's <em>Pop Memories 1890-1954</em>
        (1986), "Old Folks at Home" was the best-selling sheet music song of the
        period, with over twenty million copies sold. "Old Folks at Home" in
        print was credited to E. P. Christy on early sheet music printings.
        Christy had paid Foster to be credited, which Foster himself had
        suggested but later came to regret Foster had composed most of the
        lyrics but was struggling to name the river of the opening line, and
        asked his brother to suggest one. The first suggestion was "Yazoo" (in
        Mississippi), which despite fitting the melody perfectly, was rejected
        by Foster. The second suggestion was "Pee Dee" (in South Carolina), to
        which Foster said, "Oh pshaw! I won't have that." His brother then
        consulted an atlas and called out "Suwannee!" Foster said, "That's it,
        exactly!" Adding it to the lyrics, he purposely misspelled it as
        "Swanee" to fit the melody. Foster himself never saw the
        Suwannee&mdash;or even visited Florida&mdash;but the popularity of the
        song stimulated tourism to Florida, to see the river. (Wikipedia) Listen

        The <strong>Hudson River</strong> is a 315-mile river that flows from
        north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States.
        The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York,
        flows southward through the Hudson Valley, and eventually drains into
        the Atlantic Ocean at New York Harbor, between New York City and Jersey
        City. The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New
        Jersey and New York at its southern end. Further north, it marks local
        boundaries between several New York counties. The river is named after
        Henry Hudson, an Englishman sailing for the Dutch East India Company,
        who explored it in 1609, and after whom Hudson Bay in Canada is also
        named. (Wikipedia) Listen to the

        The <strong>Mississippi River</strong> is the chief river of the
        second-largest drainage system on the North American continent, second
        only to the Hudson Bay drainage system. The stream is entirely within
        the United States, its source is Lake Itasca in northern Minnesota and
        it flows generally south for 2,320 miles to the Mississippi River Delta
        in the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's
        watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and two Canadian
        provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi

        America. Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri
        flows east and south for 2,341 miles before entering the Mississippi
        River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a
        watershed of more than half a million square miles, which includes parts
        of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the
        lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river
        system.

        For over 12,000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and
        its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than
        ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed. The first
        Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the
        region passed through Spanish and French hands before finally becoming
        part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri
        was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage &ndash; a water
        route from the Atlantic to the Pacific &ndash; but when Lewis and Clark
        became the first to travel the river's entire length, they confirmed the
        mythical pathway to be no more than a legend. (Wikipedia) Listen to the{" "}

      <h3>All Quiet Along the Potomac To-Night</h3>

        The <strong>Potomac River</strong> is located within the Mid-Atlantic
        region of the United States and flows from the Potomac Highlands into
        the Chesapeake Bay. The river (main stem and North Branch) is
        approximately 405 miles with a drainage area of about 14,700 square
        miles. In terms of area, this makes the Potomac River the fourth largest
        river along the Atlantic coast of the United States and the 21st largest
        in the United States. Over 5 million people live within the Potomac
        watershed. The river forms part of the borders between Maryland and
        Washington, D.C., Originally a poem by Ethel Lynn Beers, it was first
        published as "The Picket Guard" in the <em>Harper's Weekly</em> issue
        dated November 30, 1861, attributed only to "E.B." It was then reprinted
        broadly, both with that attribution and without, leading to many
        spurious claims of authorship. On July 4, 1863, <em>Harper's Weekly</em>{" "}
        told its readers that the poem had been written for the paper by a lady
        contributor whom it later identified as Beers. The poem was based on
        newspaper reports of "all is quiet tonight", which was based on official
        telegrams sent to the Secretary of War by Major-General George B.
        McClellan, following the First Battle of Bull Run. Beers noticed that
        the report was followed by a small item telling of a picket being
        killed. She wrote the poem that same morning. In 1863, the poem was set
        to music by John Hill Hewitt, himself a poet, newspaperman, and
        musician, who was serving in the Confederate Army. This song may have
        inspired the title of the English translation of Erich Maria Remarque's
        World War I novel <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em>. Listen to the{" "}

      <h3>Red River Valley</h3>
      <p>

        Though this song may most often be considered a &quot;country
        western&quot; song and expectations may be that the Red River Valley was
        somewhere in the old west, in actuality the
        <strong>Red River Valley</strong> is a region in central North America
        that is drained by the Red River of the North; it is part of both Canada
        and the United States. The Red River of the North originates at the
        confluence of the Bois de Sioux and Otter Tail rivers between the U.S.
        states of Minnesota and North Dakota, it flows northward through the Red
        River Valley, forming most of the border of Minnesota and North Dakota
        and continuing into Manitoba, Canada. It empties into Lake Winnipeg,
        whose waters join the Nelson River and ultimately flow into the Hudson
        Bay. Edith Fowke offers anecdotal evidence that the song was known in at
        least five Canadian provinces before 1896.This finding led to
        speculation that the song was composed at the time of the 1870 Wolseley
        Expedition to Manitoba's northern Red River Valley. It expresses the
        sorrow of a local woman as her soldier lover prepares to return to the
        east. In 1925, Carl T. Sprague, an early singing cowboy from Texas,
        recorded it as "Cowboy Love Song" , but it was fellow Texan Jules Verne
        Allen's 1929 "Cowboy's Love Song", that gave the song its greatest
        popularity. .Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one
        of the Top 100 Western songs of all time, ranked #10. Listen to the{" "}

        .<h3>Shenandoah (Across the wide Missouri) </h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unknown Composer/Lyricist <br />
        Published 19th Century
      </p>

        "Oh Shenandoah" is a traditional American folk song of uncertain origin,
        dating to the early 19th century.The song appears to have originated
        with Canadian and American explorers or fur traders traveling down the
        Missouri River in canoes, and has developed several different sets of
        lyrics. The lyrics may refer to the Oneida chief Shenandoah and a
        canoe-going trader who wants to marry his daughter. The second verse
        lyrics reinforce that possibility. Since a main theme is the Missouri
        river, the references to the Shenandoah Valley become somewhat
        questionable. Though for many, the song could refer to the Shenandoah
        Valley in Virginia. In fact,in 2006 the state of Virginia once
        considered the song to be the state song. The proposal was contentious
        because the standard folk song refers to the Missouri River, and in most
        versions of the song the name "Shenandoah" refers to an Indian chief,
        not the Shenandoah Valley or Shenandoah River which lie almost entirely
        in Virginia. It is not surprising that many would like to claim the song
        as even though it is a short and simple melody, it is unquestionably one
        of the most beautiful melodies to come out of the folk song genre. By
        the mid 1800s versions of the song had become a sea shanty heard or sung
        by sailors in various parts of the world. Listen to the{" "}
