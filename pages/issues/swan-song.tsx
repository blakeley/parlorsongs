      <h1>Schwanengesang (Swan Song)</h1>

      <h2>The Final Parlorsongs Article</h2>

      <p>
        "In ancient legend, there are types of swans that either sing most
        beautifully when they are dying or never sing until just before death.
        Despite being untrue, the legend has survived from antiquity into modern
        times, probably because it lends itself so well to poetic allegory.
        Today it lives on primarily in the idiom{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>swan song </em>
        </strong>
        (sometimes <em>swan-song</em>), which refers to the last performance or
        work by someone who is retiring or dying. A swan song isn&rsquo;t
        necessarily the greatest work of one&rsquo;s career, but it is seen to
        have extra significance, especially if its creator produces it knowing
        it is to be his or her last work" (from the{" "}
        <a href="https://grammarist.com/usage/swan-song/" target="_blank">

        </a>
        .)
        <p>
          {" "}
          Franz Schubert memorialized the use of Swan Song in music with his{" "}
          <em>Schwanengesang</em> ("Swan song"), D 957, a collection of songs
          written by Franz Schubert at the end of his life and published
          posthumously. The collection was named by its first publisher Tobias
          Haslinger, presumably wishing to present it as Schubert's final
          musical testament to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article, has no relationship to Schubert but is presented as the
          last song (article) of the Parlorsongs.com. I started this web site in
          1996 as a part of a personal web site. the original idea was to
          showcase sheet music covers from American music from its early years
          and the music in MIDI format so that viewers could listen to the music
          as well as appreciate the covers. With small articles about each song,
          the site gained popularity and attention to the extent that it became
          its own separate site under the name of Parlorsongs. That change was
          initiated by Robert L. Maine who joined me as a partner in the web
          site's development and design way back in 1997. Over the years the
          site reached thousands of listeners, grew to include full score
          visibility and detailed articles relating to aspects of America's
          music. Later, Rich Beil, joined me and added yet new dimensions to the
          site with actual vocal performances of some of the songs, production
          of CD and a number of scholarly articles that elevated the site's
          stature.
        </p>
        <p>
          With substantial critical reviews and use of our materials across a
          wide spectrum of the educational world, the site became a template for
          many sites who followed our example. I am proud of what I have
          accomplished in the 23 years of this project and am eternally grateful
          to Robert L. Maine, Beverly Maine and Richard Beil for their support
          and assistance in making the site so successful.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadly, all things come to an end and with this article, I am providing
          a final chapter in the site with an article that represents my swan
          song. I am retiring from the site for age and health reasons and will
          continue to maintain it for another year at which point, unless
          someone cares to buy it or maintain it, the site will become another
          memory in the development of the web. My thanks to all of those over
          the years who have supported us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article is not tied to any theme as most of our previous articles
          have been. It is instead a compilation of many songs that I completed
          for publication that I never managed to publish. In total, I hope you
          enjoy my final presentation for your enjoyment.{" "}

        <h3>Carrie Jacobs-Bond songs</h3>
        <p>
          <img src="/cjb-1943.jpg" alt="Psalm19" />
          Bond speaks to the heart with her music. In fact, during her heyday
          she was described as a writer of "Heart Songs." Her music and life has
          fascinated me for years and of course I have featured her music not
          only in a{" "}
          <a href="/bios/cjbond/cjbond.php" target="_blank">
            biography
          </a>{" "}
          but in numerous articles.(see our music{" "}
          <a href="/catalog/a.php" target="_blank">
            catalog
          </a>{" "}
          for other CJB songs) Her ability to combine melody and lyrics in such
          a way as to touch the heart has, in my opinion, rarely if ever been
          matched by any composer of popular music. To that end, I have studied
          her music and collected almost every song she ever wrote. Many of her
          works never made it to our site but I continued to work with her music
          and have a number of works that I prepared for publication. Some of
          her works were little known as they were considered to be less than
          songs and more a display of her of musical expertise.
        </p>
        <img src="/perfday-violin.jpg" />
        <p>
          Here I want to share with you a recording I made of her beautiful
          "Reverie" a work for piano that is so expressive and beautiful it is
          an exemplar of her mastery of melody and emotion in music. Listen to
          Carrie Bond's "<a href="/bond-reverie.mid">Reverie</a>". Another of
          her rarely heard works is a wonderful piece called
          <a href="songs-media/chimneyswallows.mid">Chimney Swallows</a>. I
          think you may enjoy it as well. In her earliest years, one of her
          songs was
          <a href="/goingtochurch.mid">Going to Church with Mother</a>, a short
          but endearing song. Of course her most famous work was{" "}
          <a href="/APerfectDay_Violin_Score.mid">A Perfect Day</a>. As a
          violinist, I was happy to find the violin score. Finally, in
          collecting her music I obtained four orchestral scores of her songs, I
          present the wav version of these songs for your enjoyment. (all in wav
          audio format){" "}

        <h3>Military and Organization Marches and Songs</h3>
        <p>
          Over the years we have also featured many marches and military/war
          songs, especially from the Civil War and our World war music
          series.Even at that though, I have other such songs that I was never
          able to publish due to no relevant article. So, I will present to you
          a few the unpublished military related works unpublished.{" "}

          {" "}
          First, three songs dedicated to the Valiant United States Coast Guard.
          An often overlooked but heroic part of America's military. One of my
          grandchildren, Jack Redshaw proudly serves in the Coast Guard so this
          section is also dedicated to him and his shipmates who protect our
          waters and serve those in distress on the seas. The first is{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>The Coast Guard March</strong>
          </em>
          , listen to <a href="/CGmarch.wav">wav file</a>,{" "}

          . The second work is{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>The Coast Guard Forever</strong>
          </em>
          , a 1930 song that was recorded by Fred Waring and the Pennsylvanians

          </a>
          . Yet a third CG work is{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>The Silver Shield</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          "Fighting Song of the U.S. Coast Guard". This song was written during
          WWII in honor of the Coast Guard's part in fighting the war. Listen to

          Another March song unpublished is{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>The Columbia March</strong>
          </em>
          , a 1917 song by Seneca Lewis. Listen to the{" "}

          <a href="/columbia.mid">MIDI </a>or enjoy the{" "}
          <a href="/columbia.htm">score</a>.This next one is not really a
          military song but it is sort of a march. My alma mater, The Ohio State
          University "
          <em>
            <strong>Buckeye Battle Cry</strong>
          </em>
          " (<a href="/buckeyebattlecry.wav">WAV audio </a>only) is a rousing
          song designed to stir the Buckeye fans into a winning frenzy. I sang
          this one many times at home games during my time at OSU. I seem to
          have lost or misplaced the sheet music so can't display the cover.

        <h3>Classical Works.</h3>
        <p>
          As a violinist and a classical music fan for decades (I played violin
          with a community orchestra) I often sequenced and produced wav and
          MIDI files from several of the classical scores I had in my
          collection. Although I did do at least one article about{" "}
          <a
            href="http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2001-12/thismonth/feature.php"

          >
            Classics in the Parlor
          </a>
          , I have several unpublished works that I would like to share with
          those of you who enjoy classical music. Some of these were produced
          from full orchestral scores and as a result are much more robust than
          many of the piano solo works we presented over the years. Some are
          incomplete but pleasant.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/egmont.jpg" width="122" height="172" />
          Among the classics for your listening pleasure are: The Bach{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>Double Violin Concerto</strong>
          </em>
          , listen to the <a href="/Double violin concerto.wav">WAV audio</a>,

          <a href="/Doubleviolinconcerto.htm">score</a>.The{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>Hebrides Overture</strong>
          </em>
          .a leghthy score. Listen to the Hebrides in{" "}
          <a href="/Hebrides.wav">WAV audio</a> format,{" "}
          <a href="/Hebrides.mid">MIDI</a> or{" "}
          <a href="/Hebrides.htm">view the score</a> (over 100 pages). A
          Favorite is the{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>Egmont Overture</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          for piano. I published this one in December 2001 as a part of the
          article mentioned above.. Listen to the <a href="/egmont.mid">MIDI</a>
          , or view the{" "}
          <a href="/egmont.htm" target="_blank">
            score
          </a>
          . One I never finished and appropriately a good way to end this
          section of the article is The{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>Overture to the Magic Flute</strong>
          </em>{" "}
          (Die Zauberflote) by Mozart. It is only 1:14 long but shows the
          promise of how MIDI can create beautiful and complex music. Listen to
          the <a href="s/Zauberflote.wav">WAV audio</a>,{" "}
          <a href="/Zauberflote.mid">MIDI</a> or{" "}

          finish it.

        <h3>Stuff I really could not publish..</h3>
        <p>
          (Still Can't but, what the heck, this is the last installment of the
          Parlor Songs saga.) But these are some of my favorites and are a few
          that exceed the limit of Public Domain. Some of the best were scores
          of Art Tatum Jazz arrangements of standard songs, they are sublime.
          You can see them below. Another are two special requests I received
          from fans to produce MIDI's and wav files of a couple of 1960's,
          Vietnam era songs.{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>
              <a href="/WeGottaGetOutofThisPlace-Sib.mid">
                We Gotta Get Out of This Place
              </a>
            </strong>
          </em>{" "}
          was a favorite of many of the men who had the misfortune of
          experiencing the horror of Vietnam. Using a full score as a source,
          this was the only "rock" song I ever created in MIDI. A Marine Vet
          asked me to make that one. Listen to the{" "}
          <a href="/WeGottaGetOutofThisPlace-Sib.mid">MIDI</a>. Yet another
          piece from that period was the complex and long jazz work,{" "}
          <em>
            <strong>
              <a href="/hymn2freedm.mid">Hymn to Freedom</a>
            </strong>
          </em>{" "}
          sent to me by a loyal fan of Parlorsongs.com. Hear this{" "}
          <a href="/hymn2freedm.mid">MIDI</a>. That one was one of the most
          difficult to work out due to the complexity of meter and
          ornamentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="/arttatum.jpg" width="101" height="118" />
          The Art Tatum arrangements are absolute gems of piano mastery and
          every time I listen to them I am impressed and immensely entertained.
          Here are some samples:(all MIDI only){" "}

          .The Tatum works were also some of the most difficult to sequence due
          to the changing meter and complex performance ornaments.Tatum was a
          master of the piano without question.

        <p>
          <img src="/girlcrazy.jpg" width="220" height="327" />
          Several Years Ago, a Friend in England, teamed up with me to produce a
          midi version of the Broadway Show "
          <em>
            <strong>Girl Crazy</strong>
          </em>
          ." A school in England was going to produce the show and could not
          afford an orchestra so opted for use of a recorded track generated by
          MIDI. It took me many months of tedious work but managed to produce a
          complete score of the show. I share some of the best pieces for your
          consideration. Despite that, these were done in a period while I was
          still learning MIDI and scoring so they really represent some of my
          earliest work and in light of later years work, can be considered
          somewhat elementary and immature work by me. Nonetheless, these works
          bring you full circle with regards to my work. Here are some of the
          songs (all MIDI),{" "}

          <a href="/Igotrev.mid">I Got Rhythm</a>. . The most interesting piece
          within the show for me was a short, (1:11) scene change interlude that
          used a number of sound effects such as whistles and car horns. It is
          my favorite! Listen to{" "}
