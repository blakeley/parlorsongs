
 **W. T. Wrighton, (William Thomas)**, 1816-1880 I've found little about Wrighton but it appears he was a native of England and we do know he wrote quite a few songs including *The Dearest Spot*. Other songs attributed to him are; *Bright Star of Eve*, *Her Bright Smile Haunts Me Still* (1870), *The Postman's Knock*, *O Chide Not My Heart* and many others. There is some artwork also attributed to Wrighton however I cannot confirm this aspect of his talents. According to one source, Wrighton also died in England so his stay in America may have been brief, if ever.
