
**Charles Shisler** (1886 - 1952 ) is one of the many composers who have faded away with time. In fact, all but a precious few of the composers and lyricists are virtually unknown today. We do know that he wrote a number of songs and continued to publish well into the 1940's with songs such as *Lolita* (1943) and *Love Is A Melody* (1949). Beyond that, we've found little else.
