**John Howard Payne**, (1791 - 1852) The lyricist of *Home Sweet Home*, was a noted American poet, sometime actor and playwright born in New York. He was the son of William Payne, of an old Massachusetts family, and Sarah Isaacs of East Hampton. John Howard was the sixth of nine children. Payne's father was a successful teacher of elocution. He came to East Hampton to teach at Clinton Academy, the third oldest school in New York State. He trained John Howard well in diction and delivery and then was alarmed when the boy expressed a desire to go on the stage. 
A wealthy merchant offered to bear the expenses of a college education and in 1806 young Payne was sent to Union College to study under the great educator, Dr. Eliphalet Nott. While a student there he was active in the college societies and contributed poems and essays to neighboring newspapers. His life at Union was short, however, for two years later his father's bankruptcy and failing health made it necessary for him to leave Schenectady and assist in the support of his family. This gave him an opportunity to put his dramatic talents to use and in 1809 he made his debut as actor on the New York stage in the tragedy, Douglas,in which he scored an instant success. His triumph was brief and the next year found him without backing and without funds. 
In 1813 he sailed for England with money raised by friends to finance a year abroad. He stayed not one year but twenty, a period of fame, prosperity, and failure. He soon realized that as an actor he could never again attain the success of his earlier venture 
and so turned his attention to dramatic writing. During his stay in Europe he wrote, translated, or adapted for the English state more than sixty plays. He was the first American who as actor or playwright attracted attention in England.
*Home, Sweet Home*, his one claim to immortality, was included in the opera, *Clari*; or, *The Maid of Milan*, with Music by Sir Henry Rowley Bishop which was performed at the Covent Garden Theater in London in 1823. Many stories have been told as to how this song came to be written, but it seems to have been composed merely as a sentimental poetic ballad during his residence in Paris. For the play he received fifty pounds, but not one penny for the song.
A disillusioned man, Payne returned to America in 1832 with passage money provided by friends. Ten years later he was appointed American consul at Tunis, Africa, where he died on April 9, 1852.
