
**Charles Henry Pace** was born in Atlanta on August 4, 1886 and died in Pittsburgh on December 16, 1963. In 1925 he formed the Pace Jubilee Singers, an early conservative gospel group which recorded songs by Pace, Tindley, and others for Victor and Brunswick. Pace moved to Pittsburgh in 1936 and shortly afterwards organized the Pace Gospel choral Union, a 25-member ensemble that was enlarged to as many as 300 singers for special celebrations; its reperatory consisted of gospel songs and spirirtuals. Pace also founded two highly successful music publishing houses n Pittsburgh - the Old Ship of Zion Muisc Company (1936-51) and Charles H. Pace Music Publishers (1952-63) - from which he published most of his 104 sacred compositions and arrangements and 26 secular songs. Pace's gospel songs, the best known of which are *Bread of Heaven*, *Hide My Soul*, and *Nobody but you, Lord*, are in the syle of Tindley's songs, with a verse-chorus structure, memorable melodies, and simple, effective harmonies.
