
**James Lynam Molloy** was one of the 19th century's most gifted Irish songwriters. Born in Cornalaur, Rahan, which is near Tullamore, King's County, Ireland in 1837. He was well known there and wrote a number of idiomatic works in his homeland that reached high levels of popularity including *The Old Cottage Clock* and *The Kerry Dance*. Few of Molloy's works reached hit status in the US save his crowning achievent, *Love's old Sweet Song*, written when Molloy was nearly 60. Unfortunately, much of Molloys music is lost to us today though copies are still undoubtedly to be found in attics and piano benches around the world.
