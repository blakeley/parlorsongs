
**Fred C. Swan** is an elusive persona but we did find that Swan wrote a number of songs, among them are *Perhaps* (1919), *Rose Of My Dreams* (1919), *There's No Friends Like The Old Friends* (date unkn.) and *I'm In Love With The Rose Of My Dreams* (date unkn.). Clearly Swan was fixated with roses himself for 60% of his songs revolved around the rose theme.
