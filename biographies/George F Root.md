 **George F. Root** (1820 - 1895) American vocal composer and writer, Root was bornin Sheffield, Mass. The son of a farmer and the eldest of eight children he had little early opportunity to cultivate his musical talent. He studied later under George Webb in Boston and in 1839 became assistant teacher in the music school of A. N. Johnson, and organist in that city. Root also became Johnson's partner and assistant organist at the Winter Street and Park Street churches. In 1844 he moved to New York and became organist at the Presbyterian Church at Mercer Street, known as the "church of the strangers." He also took jobs as teacher of singing in various schools there. Around this time he married Mary Olive Woodman a church and concert singer. 
In 1850, Root went to Paris for a year to study and on his return began to compose music. His early works and a few later ones were published under the pseudonym "Wurzel," the German word for root. His first song, *Hazel Dell* was a success and his cantata, *The Flower Queen* produced in 1881 was quite successful as well. For several years he devoted time to composing, occasionally conducting musical conventions. One convention brought him in contact with Lowell Mason and in 1852 Root originated a summer normal school of music in New York City. The faculty included Lason, William Bradbury and Thomas Hastings. About 1860 he removed to Chicago and there became head partner in the music publishing firm of Root & Cady which realized quick financial results from the sale of Root's popular songs and collections. The firm sustained heavy losses in the fire of 1871 and soon afterward was dissolved. Mr. Root continued to live in Chicago where he composed, edited works and conducted conventions as before. In 1881 he received his degree of Doctor of Music and in 1886 visited Europe a second time. He died in his summer home on Baily Island near the Maine coast.
Many of Root's productions were immesnsely popular in their day, especially the songs belonging to the time of the Civil War. While they do not belong to the classics, they are at least superior to the majority of the popular songs of the present day in purity of sentiment.
Aside from his songs, Root also wrote a number of cantataa, quartets, church music music curricula, and instruction books for piano and organ. Among his most popular songs are; *Battle Cry of Freedom*; *Just Before The Battle*; *Tramp, Tramp, Tramp*; *The Vacant Chair*; *A Hundred Years Ago*; *Hazel Dell* and *Just After The Battle*. In case you are wondering about some of the odd sentence constructions and word usage in this biography, it is taken from a 1908 music encylopedia.
