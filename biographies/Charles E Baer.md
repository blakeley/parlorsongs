The earliest song by him I've been able to find is his 1896 work, Pictures from the Other Side of Life which he wrote both words and music. That song is a rather lenghty work that speaks to a number of "scenes" in American life far from what we want to see; a gambler who has lost everything, a lonely mother who is forgotten, two brothers one of which became rich and the other destitute and a mother and child, cast off and homeless. Other songs by him include; *My Sweet Eileen* (1898, lyrics), *When the Robin Red-breast, Sings his Home, Sweet Home* (1901, lyrics), *When the Orioles Come North Again* (1906, lyrics) and *For the Blue Juniata I Am Longing* (1901, lyrics and music).
