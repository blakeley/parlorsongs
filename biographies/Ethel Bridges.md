
**Ethel Bridges** (1879 - 1951) Bridges greatest collaboration was with the lyricist Dorothy Terriss (Theodora Morse)with whom she wrote several other songs; *Hawaiian Lullaby* (1919); *Beautiful Hawaiian Love* (1920); *Ching a Ling’s Jazz Bazaar*, (1920). Othe songs were with Howard Johnson; *Whispering* and *Hawaiian Lullaby*, 1919. Among her other works are *Soldier's Life* (1941) with lyricist Tom Woodburn. With so many best selling works to her credit, you would think that she would rate mention in more than a few reference volumes about American popular music yet I could find no mention of her beyond song titles in the over 30 reference works I have. What a slap in the face!
