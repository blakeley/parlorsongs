**Eugene Lockhart**, the lyricist for *The World Is Waiting For The Sunrise* was best known not as a songwriter but as a playwright and actor on stage and screen. Lockhart was Born in London, Ontario/Canada July 18, 1891. He is immediately recognizable to fans of old movies as the kindly and cornered Judge who must decide if "Santa" is real from Miracle on 34th Street, but it's likely that the vast majority of people under 60 would recognize him. His biography mentions nothing of his songwriting and I believe the lyrics for this song were simply an outgrowth of his having writen a play by the same name. Among his plays are; *The Pierrot Players*, *Heigh-Ho*, and *The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise*. During the 1920s and 1930s, he appeared in a number of Broadway productions, including *Sun Up, The Little Father of the Wilderness*, *The Way of the World*, *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, and *Ah, Wilderness*. Among the films he appeared in were; *Algiers*, *Meet John Doe*, *The Sea Wolf* and *The Devil and Daniel Webster*. Lockhart began a career in TV in 1955 but unfortunately, a heart attack took him in March of 1957 cutting his last acting activities off while he was still quite popular.
