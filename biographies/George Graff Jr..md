
**George Graff Jr.** (b. 1886 - d. 1973) Graff was a prominent lyricist during the early years of Tin Pan Alley. He wrote lyrics for individual songs as well as entire shows (*Isle O' Dreams*, 1912 with Ernest R. Ball). Chauncy Olcott, the famed "Irish" singer asked Graff to write another song for the show and Graff responded with what is arguable the best "Irish" song of all time, *When Irish Eyes Are Smiling*. Though he was a successful songwriter, Graff later became an investment counselor and later retired to live in the Poconos. (Claghorn, p. 180). Among Graff's works are; *Till The Sands of the Desert Grow Cold* (1911), *I Love The Name of Mary* (1910), *Good-by My Love*, Good-Bye* (1911), *While the Rivers of Love Flow On* (1913), *Wake Up America!* (1916) and *Blue Bird Bring Back My Happiness* (1917)
