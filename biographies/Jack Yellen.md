**Jack Yellen** (b. 1892, Poland, d. 1991) Jack was brought to the US in 1897 and was a songwriter and reporter for the Buffalo (NY) Courier in his early years. Yellen's best known songs today are probably his 1932 work, *Happy Days Are Here Again*, used in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Presidential campaign and *Ain't She Sweet* from 1927. Yellen, like many writers of the times, also founded a publishing house with his long time collaborator Milton Ager and Borenstein. After graduating with Honors from the University of Michigan in 1913 Jack went to work for the Buffalo Courier as a sportï¿½s writer. His first collaborator on a song was George L. Cobb with whom Jack wrote a series of Dixie songs including *Are You From Dixie?*, *Alabama Jubilee* and *All Aboard for Dixieland*. Besides his individual songs, Yellen was a prolific writer of Broadway scores and his credits in this area include; *What's In A Name* (1920), *Rain Or Shine* (1929), *You Said It* (1931) and *Son O' Fun* (1941). Yellen also wrote motion picture screen plays and several novelty songs for Sophie Tucker. His chief songwriting collaborator was Milton Ager but he also worked with other greats including George L. Cobb, Lew Pollack, Harold Arlen and Sammy Fain.
