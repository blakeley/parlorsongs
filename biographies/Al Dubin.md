**Al Dubin** (b. 1891 Zurich, d. 1945 New York, NY) Dubin is considered one of the most important lyricists of the Tin Pan Alley (and beyond) era. His output is described by Kinkle (V. 2, p.839) as astonishing. He collaborated with some of the greatest composers of the period and wrote an also astonishing number of lasting hits. 
Dubin's family emigrated to the US in 1893 and settled in Pennsylvania. Dubin was educated at Perkiomen Seminary in Pennsburg, Montgomery County, Pa. Dubin worked as a staff writer for a number of New York publishers and served in World War I. His success is described as moderate till he teamed up with Harry Warren at which point his career skyrocketed. Though he wrote many songs before the 20's, it was after 1920 that he was most productive and successful. He wrote many songs for movies including one large score for the film *Stage Door Canteen* in 1943. Among his collaborations are Jimmy McHugh, J. Russel Robinson, Joe Burke and Jimmy Monaco. Dubin was a large man and was characterized by his own daughter as a glutton. At one point his weight exceeded 300 lbs. and was also a heavy drinker. It is likely his lifestyle contributed to his untimely death.
Some of his many greatest hits are; *Tiptoe Through The Tulips With Me*, *42nd Street*, *Shuffle Off To Buffalo*, *I Only Have Eyes For You*, *Lullaby of Broadway* and *Indian Summer*. Dubin continued to write songs up to his death at age 53 of pneumonia.
