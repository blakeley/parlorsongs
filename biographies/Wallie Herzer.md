The rest of the story on this creative composer is seemingly unknown. I was unable to even find birth and death dates or any other information. The cover states the work was "Featured in J.C. Williamson's Musical Play *Katinka*." *Katinka* is based on a Russian story about a woman who marries out of a sense of duty but who loves another. The story seems to have been produced in a number of versions by several composers, the most prominent and lasting being by Rudolf Friml in 1916. Friml's version resulted in a number of hit songs.
