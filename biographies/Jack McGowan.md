
**Jack McGowan** (b. 1894 - d. 1977) started his career in Broadway primarily as a performer and writer. His first few years from about 1919 to 19276 were as a performer in such shows as *Take it From Me* (1919), *The Blue Devil* (1920), *George White's Scandals* (1922) and *The Rise of Rosie O'Reilly* (1923). In 1926, McGowan began writing shows and continued to write, direct and produce Broadway shows up till his last, *Say When* in 1935. His other Broadway credits include; *Mama Loves Papa* (1926), *The Lady Lies* (1928), *Heads Up* (1929) and *Girl Crazy* (1930). 
In 1933 McGowan began writing screenplays for Hollywood. "After collaborating on the script of Paramount's *Sitting Pretty* (1933), he moved to MGM, where he'd spend the rest of his movie career. He contributed gags and storylines to such big-budget MGM musicals as *Born to Dance* (1936), *Babes in Arms* (1939), *Little Nellie Kelly* (1940), *Girl Crazy* (1943) and *Broadway Rhythm* (1944). Jack McGowan also co-wrote the 1936, 1938 and 1940 editions of MGM's Broadway Melody series." (Quote demarked information by Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide as found on Yahoo! Movies.) I found one other song attributed to Mc Gowan; *I Have To Laugh*, from 1931.
