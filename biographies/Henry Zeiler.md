
**Henry Zeiler** enjoyed an apparent brief career as a published composer in that only a few of his works seem to have made it to today's libraries. In 1903 he published *My Lady Love Waltzes*, in 1904 he wrote a set of variations on *Nearer My God To Thee* and then in 1908 he wrote and published *Flight of the Air Ship*. All of his works are for piano solo.
