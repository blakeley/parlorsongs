"J." has a nuimber of later works attributed to him as composer and several where he is credited as the arranger. The original works by him include the *Twentieth Century* (1900), *Love and Passion* (1902), *In The Valley of Roses With You* (1919) and *Wayside Chapel Reverie* (1930). He arranged a number of other popular works including one arrangement of the famous *Robin's Return* in 1926.
