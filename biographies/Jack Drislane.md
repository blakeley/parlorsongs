
**Jack Drislane** (dates unkn.) As with many of Tin Pan Alley's songwriters, Drislane's fairly prolific production did nothing to assure that the details of his life would survive beyond his name association with many important songs of the era. His songs include *Arrah Wanna* (1906), *Keep A Cozy Corner In Your Heart For Me* (1905) and *Nobody's Little Girl* (1907) all in collaboration with Theodore Morse. All of my references make scant mention of Drislane other than his association with Morse. Quite a shame and as always, if any relatives or others who know more about Drislane can inform us, we'll be happy to update our composers database.
