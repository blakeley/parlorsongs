**Paul Dresser** (1857 - 1906) Was born in Terre Haute Indiana. Born Paul Drieser, his brother was the famed novelist Theodore Dreiser (*Sister Carrie*, *An American Tragedy*). Dresser's father was a religeous man and urged his son to become a priest. Dresser however would have non of it and put his life energy into his love for music. He loved to play piano, guitar and sing. At age 16, he ran away from home to join a medicine show that sold "wizard oil" and it was then that he changed his name to Paul Dresser. He spent several years wandering from troupe to troupe and in his spare time took to writing songs. His first published work was Wide Wings, published in Evansville.
In 1885 he joined a minstrel troupe and performed in black face and wrote songs for the show. His first hit came in 1886, the sentimental ballad, *The Letter That Never Came*. Lore has it that he was inspired to write the song over a failed love affair. Regardless of the songs provenance, it established his reputation as a songwriter and success upon success followed. Most of his songs were popular during the grand period of the sentimental ballad from 1890 to 1900 and the titles reflect that sentimentality. Such songs as *I Wonder if She'll Ever Come Back to Me*, *I Wish That You Were Here Tonight* and *Just Tell Them That You Saw Me* were some of his most popular. 
By 1901, Dresser had joined with his publisher as a partner and the frim Howley and Haviland became Howley, Haviland and Dresser. Unfortunately, by this time Dresser's popularity was waning and his creativity seemed to have been used up. Dresser's prior success had allowed him to live a lavish lifestyle and he lived in grand style. As a result he squandered his fortunes and ultimately ended up bankrupt. As a result, he had no funds to fall back on and the firm ended up bankrupt also and Dresser's health and spirit seemed broken. He did have one last hurrah left, and it was his best. In 1905 he wrote *My Gal Sal* and published it at his own expense. A huge hit, selling millions of copies, Dresser did not live to enjoy the success and died in January of 1906 of a heart attack in abject poverty at his sister's home in Brooklyn. In 1942, a screen biography, *My Gal Sal* was released starring Victor Mature as Dresser.
Though Dresser was a prolific songwriter and one whose songs were quite successful in their time, few of his songs have stayed in the repertoire to this day. The two exceptions are *My Gal Sal* and *On The Banks of The Wabash* (1899), now the official state song of Indiana.
