
**Wendell W. Hall** is billed as "the singing xylophonist" on the sheet music. He was born in 1896 in St. George Kansas. The biographical material I have does not say a word about him being a xylophonist! Hall was educated at the University of Chicago Preparatory school and served in WWI. He became known as "the red-headed music maker" on radio and made a world radio tour from 1924 to 1927. He was a singer, guitarist (later, ukeleleist) and composer. His most popular and lasting composition was a song based on a Negro spiritual, *It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo'*, composed in 1923. He also wrote a song titled *The Red-Headed Music Maker* in 1924. *Underneath The Mellow Moon* was made into a piano roll by US Best Piano Rolls and the box title lists it as a "Waltz -Marimba"
