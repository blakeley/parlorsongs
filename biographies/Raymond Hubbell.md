Harris as a pianist and arranger and in many respects wrote the music for many of Harris' songs. As a composer he wrote the music for a large number of successful Broadway musicals including *Chow Chow* (1902), *Fantana* (1905), *A Knight For A Day* (1907), *Hip Hip Hooray* (1915), *The Bid Show* (1916), *Cheer Up* (197), *The Elusive Lady* (1922), *Yours Truly* (1927) and *Three Cheers* in 1928 starring Will Rogers and Dorothy Stone. In total, he wrote music for over 30 Broadway productions including several editions of the Ziegfeld Follies. Perhaps his most enduring hit was *Poor Butterfly* witten in 1916 for the production The Big Show.
