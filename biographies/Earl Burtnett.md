Educated at Pennsylvania State College, he arranged music for Art Hickman and his band till 1929 when he took over the band. Their good ensemble sound assured them of play in some of the leading ballrooms in the midwest including the Drake Hotel in Chicago. His many songs include; *Canadian Capers* (1915), *Down Honolulu Way* (1916, ) *Do You Ever Think Of Me* (1920), *Leave Me With a Smile* (1921), *Mandalay* (1924) and *'Leven Thirty Saturday Night* (1930).
