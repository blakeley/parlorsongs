**Victor Herbert** (b. Dublin, 1859 - d. New York City, 1924) Herbert was three when his father died and he and his mother went to live with her father in a small town near London. Sinve his grandfather, Samuel Lover was a man of letters and dramatist, the boy grew up in a cultured atmosphere where he learned to appreciate the arts. At seven he began studying piano with his mother. He showed such talent that his mother and grandfather sent him to Germany for intensive music study. In Stuttgart he studied music with a specialty in cello. He played with several orchestras and was became first cellist at the Stuttgart Royal Orchestra. During that time he began writing music and wrote a suite and a concerto for cello and orchestra. Described as a commanding man, he was always well tailored and showed wit and good manners. He married Theresa F�rster in 1886 and shortly thereafter they traveled to America where the good Fr�ulein was engaged to perform with the Metropolitan Opera Company.
In New York, Herbert joined the Metropolitan Opera Company orchestra and soon became an American citizen, never again to return to Ireland or Germany. For a while Herbert performed as a soloist and formed and conducted and orchestra. He also formed the New York String Quartet and became a faculty member of the National Conservatory of Music. His compositional efforts up till 1893 were focused entirely on concert works. Then Lillian Russel commisioned him to write an operetta, *La Vivandi�re*, which was never produced, supposedly because it was not up to her standards. Undaunted, Herbert was taken by popular song and operetta and the next year he wrote *Prince Ananias* and with it was launched the popular and musical stage career of one of America's greatest somg writers. A number of stage productions culminating in what is arguably, his greatest operetta, *Babes In Toy Land*.
In addition to his operettas, many of the songs from them became stand alone hits (i.e. *Toy Land*) and he wrote a number of enduring hits we still sometimes hear today. Among them are *Ah! Sweet Mystery Of Life*, *Gypsy Love Song*, *In Old New York*, *Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!* and *You Belong To Me*. His 1924 song and operetta of the same name *My Dream Girl* were his last. Herbert died in New York City in 1924 of a heart attack.
