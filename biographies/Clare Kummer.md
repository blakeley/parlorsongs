**Clare Kummer** ( b 1873 New York, d.1958 Carmel, California) Related to Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, Kummer was born Clare Rodman Beecher and married Frederic Kummer, also a writer of novels and short stories. Kummer was also related to William Gilette, a film writer and actor.With so much talent in the family, it's no surprise that Kummer herself was a writer, somposer and also a notable director of Broadway stage works. Her credits span a long career from 1903 til the mid fourties with no less than twenty-three plays and musicals to her credit. Some of her more successful shows/plays were; *A Knight For A Day* (1907), *The Rescuing Angel* (1917), *Bridges* (1921), *Annie Dear* (1924), *Her Master's Voice* (1933) and her final play, *Many Happy Returns* in 1945. Many of her most popular songs also came from her shows including *Only With You*, *My Very Own*, *Dearie*, *Cheating*, *The Garden of Dreams* and her most whimsical song from 1904, *In the Dingle-dongle-dell*. Many of Kummer's papers, scores, manuscripts and poems are maintained at the Manuscripts Division, Department of Rare Books and Special Collections at Princeton University Library.
