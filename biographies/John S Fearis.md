
**John. S. Fearis** (b. 1867 - d. 1932) Fearis was a publisher as well as composer, having his own house in Chicago, J. S. Fearis & Bros. It seems that much of his work was focused on children's or teaching works for that is mainly what seems to have survived to today. His most famous works are *Beautiful Isle of Somewhere* (1897) and *Little Sir Echo* (1917). Among his other works are; *Girl With The Curl* (1914), a series of six pieces titled *The Flower Garden* (1905), *Bachelor Sale* (1911) and S*ix Little Playmates* (1906). Fearis also wrote one operetta, *The Treasure Hunters*.
