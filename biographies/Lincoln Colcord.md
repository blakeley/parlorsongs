He was born in 1883 at sea off Cape Horn, South Africa. "Captain Lincoln Alden Colcord and his new wife, Jane Sweetser Colcord, departed on a two-year voyage on the bark Charlotte A. Littlefield in June of 1881. The voyage would take them around the world and witness the birth of their daughter Joanna in the South Sea Islands and young Lincoln's arrival during a treacherous winter storm off Cape Horn."( http://home.gwi.net/~tilbury/letters). Lincoln (jr) attended the University of Maine and graduated in 1906. The arranger of the music, A.W. Sprague later joined the U of Maine faculty and chaired the Department of Music. It would appear that the *Stein Song* was his only foray into songwriting.
