The work is stated to be *The Melody Ballad Hit of The Better Ole* which I assume is a stage work. In searching other sources, I did find one other work by her, *Little Lights of Home*, date unknown. This song was a very popular one and one of the biggest hits of 1918. It was recorded a number of times. Theodore H. Metz (b. Hanover, Germany, 1848 - d. New York, 1936) was the bandleader for a popular minstrel group, the McIntyre and Heath Minstrels who first introduced the song (hence the coon song structure).
