
**Robert F. Roden** (? - 1934) Though I've been able to find virtually no biographical information on Roden, I have found a number of songs and/or writings by him. Roden was primarily a film writer having written the story or adaptation to several silent era films including *Little Miss Nobody* (1917), *Greater Than Love* (story) and *Suspicious Wives* (1921). His most popular song (lyrics) is probably the 1908 song *When It's Moonlight On The Prairie*.
