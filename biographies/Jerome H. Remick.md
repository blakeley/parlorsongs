Remick & Sons in Detroit and established an office in New York in the heart of Tin Pan Alley. Remick was another of the most influential publishers of Tin Pan Alley. Oddly enough, hours of searching Detroit Newspaper archives and the New York Times archives (on-line) turned up nothing more than a photo of Remick's headstone in a Detroit cemetery. Remick along with the other pioneering publishers have seemed to disappear of the face of the earth. We do know that Remick's played a key role in the development of popular music and that many of America's greatest composers got their start there. One of the luminaries was George Gershwin who when he was fifteen, persuaded his skeptical mother to allow him to leave school and he took a job as a song-plugger at Remick's in the heart of Tin Pan Alley. George learned the business quickly, and just as quickly became bored with the ordinary quality of the material he had to play all day. He even had a song published, *When You Want 'Em You Can't Get 'Em*, for which he received the grand sum of $5.
