
**C.(Carl) Cramer** was the brother of Johann Baptist Cramer (1771 - 1858) a prominent German composer and musician and son of Wilhelm Cramer a celebrated composer, violinist and conductor. Carl was a also a celebrated violinist and a respected music teacher. He also composed a number of works including *Le Petit Rien*, a set of Etudes for piano and the melody for *How Can I Leave Thee* as arranged by Petri. What is unknown to me at this time is whether or not this song was originally titled as the same and whether or not the lyrics were the same when originally written by Cramer.
