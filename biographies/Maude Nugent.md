**Maude Nugent** (1877 - 1958) is best known as the writer of a much more remembered and popular song, *Sweet Rosie O'Grady*, published in 1896. As with many accomplishments by women, Nugent's authorship of the song was cast into doubt by some at the time who felt it must have been written instead by her more well known husband, composer William Jerome. However, Nugent's own performances of the song brought it into popularity and her reputation as a songwriter became cemented as a result. Nugent was born in Brooklyn NY and showed a great deal of musical and performing talent. She was a successful singer, actress vaudeville performer and songwriter. 
Many of her songs had an Irish theme and include several "Irish" titles besides "Rosie", including, *Down At Rosie Reilly's Flat*, *My Irish Daisy* and *Mary From Tipperary*. Much to her credit, she retired from the stage at the tender age of 28 to raise a family. Obviously, she continued to compose as this song would have been written some four years after her "retirement." In her later years she returned to the stage to perform in nostalgic "gay nineties" shows and was featured a number of times on television in the 1950's while in her eighties! Nugent died in New York in June of 1958.
