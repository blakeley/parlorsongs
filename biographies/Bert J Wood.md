**Bert J. Wood** as with far too many performers and songwriters of the times is lost to us, at least to me. I'm unable to find any information about him and this one song *You're The Brightest Star Of All My Dreams* seems to be the only one to his credit that has survived. The song is not mentioned in any of our references, nor is he. His photo (shown) was inset on the cover.
