**E.T. (Edward Taylor) Paull** (February 16, 1858 - November 27, 1924) Was the son of Virgina farmers and started his musical career as manager of a music store, selling pianos and organs in Martinsburg , Virginia around 1878. It is unclear as to his activities for the next 20 years but his first successful march was *The Chariot Race or Ben Hur March* (MIDI) in 1894. The great sucess of this march caused Paull to begin a steady stream of works. He started his own publishing company around this same period and continued publishing under his name till his death (at which time the company was bought and continued to publish under the same name for two years afterward). Though best known today for his marches, Paull did write other works and even wrote one piece for silent film *Armenian Maid* in 1919. Marches were wildly popular and though Paull was capable of composing fine works, he often obtained works by others and arranged them and released them under his banner. This work is one such work. His last work was the 1924, *Spirit Of The U.S.A.*, copyrighted just six weeks before his death.
