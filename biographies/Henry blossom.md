Blossom was primarily a librettist and lyricist in the musical world but his original profession was that of an insurance broker. His *Kiss Me Again*  was from the show *Mlle. Modiste*, first staged in 1905. Blossom wrote the libretto (book) for no less than sixteen shows, with his last, *The Velvet Lady*, staged shortly before his death in 1919. Some of Blossom's works have been performed as recently as 1981.
