Though we do know that she composed a number of very popular songs such as *I Wish I Had A Girl* (1908), *Everybody Rag With Me* (1914), *Early in the Morning*, and *On The Good Ship Mary Ann*, (1914) as well as many others. She also is credited with several instrumental only compositions. She seemed to have a long lasting collaboration with lyricist Gus Kahn, about whom much is known. Interestingly and somewhat rudely, though Le Boy wrote the music for *I Wish I had a Girl*, it is listed as "Gus Kahns first hit." Duh, wouldn't that make it Le Boy's hit too? Am I the only one that notices the incredible sexism that existed in the early years of America's music related to woman composers?
