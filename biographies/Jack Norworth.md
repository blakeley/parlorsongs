**Jack Norworth** ( 1879, Philadelphia - d. 1959, Laguna Beach, Ca.) Norworth was a famed vaudevillian who also composed and wrote songs as well as Broadway musicals. Norworth was married to the great Nora Bayes, also a songwriter and with her wrote one of Tin Pan Alley's greatest hits, *Shine On Harvest Moon*. Norworth performed in a variety of modes including blackface as a minstrel and even at sea with Nora. He starred in a number of Broadway shows (again, with Bayes) including; *The Jolly Bachelors* (1909), *Little Miss Fix-It* (1911) and *Roly Poly* (1912). Norworth collaborated with other famed songwriters and wrote the words to baseball's greatest hit, *Take Me Out To The Ball Game* in 1908. Other Norworth compositions include; *I'm Sorry*, *Honey Boy*, *Smarty* and *Way Down In Cuba*. He collaborated with Von Tilzer in writing the Broadway show *Odds And Ends of 1917*. The 1944 film, *Shine On Harvest Moon* portrayed the life of Bayes and Norworth and starred Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan in the title roles.
