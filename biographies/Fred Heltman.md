
**Fred Heltman** enjoyed much greater success as a publisher than as a songwriter as his Cleveland publishing house became a respected one that published a number of well regarded songs. However Heltman himself did write quite a large number of songs, several of which were hits among them; *Chewin' the Rag*, 1912; *The Beautiful Land of Somewhere*, 1918; *Daisy*, a rag from 1914; *Every Girl Was Meant For Someone*, 1913 and *Fred Heltman's Rag* in 1918. Heltman's rags continue to find performance outlets and are respected among ragtime performers and collectors. Oddly enough, little mention is made of him in publications about early American popular song.
