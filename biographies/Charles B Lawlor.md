
**Charles B. Lawlor** was part of a vaudeville team including James Thornton. The lyricist, James Blake was a salesman in a hatter's shop who liked to write verses. Lawlor, described as a "buck and wing" performer² and amateur composer also had written some verses about New York. Lawlor whistled the original tune to Blake, who took their combined ideas and created the full lyrics we know today. The two convinced Gilson to perform the song and it is said that the audience became so enchanted that they joined her in singing a repeat of the chorus. As with many of the lasting hits, it is the choruses that are most remembered. Very few people have heard the full verse and choruses so we are pleased to present the complete songs and lyrics to you through the scorch presentation format.
