**Arthur J. Lamb** (b. 1870, Somerset, England - d. 1928, Providence, R.I.) is perhaps most well known as the lyricist for the famous and still popular, *Asleep In The Deep* (for a German version, see Des Seemanns Los in our feature about music of the sea). This song though, was his best selling hit song at the time. As with many songwriters, Lamb followed up the success of "Asleep" with *At The Bottom Of The Deep Blue Sea* in 1899 and another sea themed song, *Out Where The Billows Roll High* in 1901, both with music by W.H. Petrie. Other popular songs by Lamb include *Dreaming Of Mother And Home*, 1898, *When The Bell In The Lighthouse Rings Ding, Dong*, 1905, *The Bird On Nellie's Hat*, 1905, *You Splash Me and I'll Splash You*, 1907 and the 1917 War song, *Good Luck To The USA*.
