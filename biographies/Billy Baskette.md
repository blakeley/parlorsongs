He wrote *Hawaiian Butterfly* (1917), *Dream Train* (1929) and *Hoosier Sweetheart* (1927) to name only a few. One of his songs, *Baby's Prayer Will Soon Be Answered* was written in 1919 in response to his earlier song *Just A Baby's Prayer at Twilight* (For Her Daddy Over There) a pair of late war songs hoping for a soldier's safe return.
