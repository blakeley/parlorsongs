They recorded songs together for a number of famous labels. Bernard usually sang while Robinson played the piano and added some vocals. Together they composed a number of hit songs including *Blue Eyed Sally* and *Let Me Be The First To Kiss You Good Morning*. For a brief period in the early 20's Bernard was teamed with the Great Jimmy Durante and wrote the lyrics for *Papa String Bean* for Durante. Through it all Bernard continued to be a popular recording star and enjoyed a long career as a singer. Some of his recordings can still be found for sale across the net as prized collector's items. Ernest Hare was also a singer of some fame during the twenties and from 1925 -29 was teamed with Billy Jones. Together they recorded a number of novelty and comedy songs and were known as the "Happiness Boys." I could find no information about Schafer.
