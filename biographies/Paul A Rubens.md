
**Paul A. Rubens** wrote a substantial number of books, lyrics and music for Broadway shows. Though his dates are not to be found in any of my references (and searches for him on the net are flooded with articles about the Flemish painter Paul Rubens) but we do know the titles of many of the shows he wrote. Few of his songs found success outside the context of the shows they appeared in. His first musical was *A Country Girl* in 1902 and he continued writing shows till at least 1925. Among his other works are; *Three Little Maids* (1903), *Miss Hook Of Holland* (1908), *The Sunshine Girl* (1913) and *Naughty Cinderella* (1925).
