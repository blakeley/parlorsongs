**Louis A. Hirsch** (b. 1887, New York City., d. 1924, New York City) In his senior year at City College of New York, Louis, a native New Yorker, went to Europe for a few months. His ambition was to be a concert pianist, and so he wanted to study at Berlin's Stern Conservatory, with pianist Rafael Joseffy. He returned to the U.S. in 1906, but turned his efforts to more pratical ends. Hirsch started working in the Tin Pan Alley publishing houses of Gus Edwards, and Shapiro-Bernstein. He also began to write some of his own music. 
His first assignment was writing music for the Lew Dockstader's Minstrels. From 1907 to 1909, some of his tunes were included in various Broadway shows, including *The Gay White Way*, *Miss Innocence* and *The Girl and the Wizard*. In 1911, Hirsh wrote the score for the *Revue of Revues*, which introduced French star Gaby Deslys to Americans. The 1911 production *Vera Violetta* was his first major success. Starring relative unknown, Al Jolson, this production helped propel Jolson to stardom. 
In 1912 Hirsch was hired by the Schuberts and as a result he was involved in a number of successful productions with them including, *The Whirl of Society*, 1912, also starring Al Jolson; *The Passing Show of 1912*; *Always Together*, and *The Wedding Glide*.
In 1913, Hirsch quit the Schuberts, and traveled to England, only to return to the U.S. at the start of WW1. He went to work for Florenz Ziegfeld. Working mainly with lyricist Gene Buck, he wrote songs four several productions of the famed Ziegfeld Follies. Among his many hits are; *Sweet Kentucky Lady*, 1914; *Hello Frisco!*, 1915, *Going Up* from the musical of the same name in 1917; and the 1920 hit *Love Nest*, perhaps Hirsch's most successful song, which later became the Burns and Allen radio show theme. Louis Hirsch died in New York City, in 1924, of pneumonia.
