He attended Trinity College of Music in Oxford, beating out Gustav Holst in a scholarship competition. Although he achieved some critical recognition for his choral and chamber works, his greatest success was in descriptive pieces, much along the lines of Delius's *In the Fens*, but with much more exotic subjects. His *In a Persian Market,* *In a Chinese Temple Garden*, and *In a Monastery Garden* were very popular with theater orchestras and in sheet music form. Although this type of music is now out of style, it was well considered at the time. Ketelby was in some ways the last of a line that included Johann Strauss and Franz Lehar.
