
**Clarence Gaskill** (1892 - 1947) As a child Gaskill played piano in local theaters then later he toured Vaudeville as the Melody Monarch. He owned his own publishing house for while still a young man. Gaskill served in the US Army during WWI. He wrote songs off and on and though he has a slight output, several of his songs are noteworthy. In 1922 he wrote the score for a stage show, *Frank Fay's Fables* which was a flop. He also wrote songs for Earl Carroll's *Vanities of 1925*. That show enjoyed a long run but unfortunately none of Gaskill's songs became popular beyond the show's run. Occasionally he also wrote material for night club revues. Among his more important songs are; *I Love You Just The Same Sweet Adeline* (1919), *Doo Wacka Doo* (1924), and *Prisoner of Love* (1931).
