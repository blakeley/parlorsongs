
**Joseph M. Daly** wrote a number of works, most of which were songs rather than instrumental rags. Included in his credits are *Scented Roses Waltzes* (1909), *Good Fellowship; March and two-step*, (1912), *Just for a Dear Little Girl*, (1910) and *The Chicken Reel* (1910), which gained a certain amount of notoriety in being performed by Garrison Keillor et. al on the *Prairie Home Companion* TV show in January of 2000. As well as having written many contemporary works, Daly also had his own publishing house and had some distinction in publishing at least one of Joplin's Rags.
