**Albert Von Tilzer** ( born Albert Gumm, b. 1878, Indianapolis - d. 1956, Los Angeles)was the brother of the famous Harry Von Tilzer.( 1872 - 1946) Albert, was one of five children, and found a career in music, more or less following his older brother Harry. It was Harry who decided to change his name to the more "gussied up" Von Tilzer (their mother's maiden name was Tilzer and Harry added the "Von" to make it more impressive) and Albert followed to capitalize on Harry's success. 
Though Albert followed his brother in many ways, he was definitely a fine composer in his own right. He started his career as a 
plugger in 1899 and also worked for his brother's firm, von Tilzer Music Publishers. In 1900 he wrote *The Absent Minded Beggar Waltz*, a rather unauspicious start. He went on to write hundreds of songs, many of them hits at that time and several of which are enduring hits still heard today. Among his greatest works are *I'll Be With You In Apple Blossom Time*, (1920), *Take Me Out To The Ball Game* (1908) and, *Put Your Arms Around me Honey*.
