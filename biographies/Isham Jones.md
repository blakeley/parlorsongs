Passionate about music from an early age, at 18, young Isham started and led his own band. Then in 1915, he moved to Chicago where he played tenor Sax and led a trio. Later he led an orchestra at Green Mill, and at the Rainbow Gardens in Erie, Pennsylvania. By the twenties, Jones was well established and was sought after by some of the best venues. In 1924, he appeared in New York before sailing to London, England. 
During this time Jones and his band appeared on many recordings and he became very popular. Jones became equally important as a composer during this period and many of his songs have become standards. He managed to compose hits every year through the twenties and thirties. His hits include; *I'll See You In My Dreams* (1924), *It Had To Be You* (1924), *My Castle In Spain* (1926), *Song Of The Blues* (1929), *Let's Try Again* (1932) , *No Greater Love* (1936) and *How Many Tears Must Fall* (1948). After the 30's Jones involvement in music became spotty and he led bands at intervals between near obscurity, mostly on the west coast. Jones died in 1956 in Hollywood, Ca.
