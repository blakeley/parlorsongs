
**Alfred Solman** (1868 - 1937) Was one of Tin Pan Alley's more prolific lyricists who collaborated with a number of composers. In spite of his output, little biographical information is available for him. His most successful work is probably his 1916 song, *There's a Quaker Down in Quaker Town*. Other works from his pen include; *The Bird On Nellie's Hat*, 1906; *Why Did You Make Me Care*, 1912; *In the Sweet Long Ago*, 1916; *The Heart You Lost in Maryland*, *You'll Find in Tennessee*, 1907; *My Lonely Lola Lo (In Hawaii)*, 1916, *Clean Hands and Tainted Gold* (1906) and *In the Valley of the Moon*, 1913.
