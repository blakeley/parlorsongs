
**Bertrand J. H.(Joseph Hubert) Hoffacker** (1828 - 1892) Bertrand Joseph Hubert Hoffacker, was born in Cologne, Germany in 1828 and was later known as Joseph, Bertrand, or BJ. He was the oldest of at least eight children. While still in Cologne, he became a "Baumeister" or master carpenter. He was an active member of the Social-Democrat Party in Prussia and perhaps the Party's defeat in 1848 led to Bertrand's departure for America. He married Louise Dietz in Cologne, and shortly thereafter, they emigrated to the U.S. arriving in New York in November of 1851. 
Bertrand was a great admirier of William Cullen Bryant, the poet and editor of the New York Evening Post. He dedicated some of his musical compositions to WC Bryant and set some of Bryant's poems to music. I don't know whether they ever met, but they definitely corresponded. Some of my distant cousins have the original letters that Bryant wrote to Bertrand. At Bertrand's request, Mr. Bryant wrote a letter of introduction for him to meet President Lincoln dated December 10, 1863:

>“To Mr. Lincoln,
President of the United States.
Sir,
>
>Mr. Bertrand J. Hoffacker of this city being about to visit Washington has desired from me a letter to you which I give him with great pleasure. Mr. Hoffacker is the author of the words and music of a composition entitled the “National Union Hymn” which has been received with great acceptance and sung in public and private circles. He is a man of the most fervent loyalty which he has taken more than one occasion to express in spiritual airs and harmonies. Mr. Hoffacker’s means of subsistence are not affluent and he and his friends would be gratified if he were allowed to serve the country in some of its numerous posts.
I am, Sir
Most respectfully yours.
Wm. C. Bryant”

Unfortunately, we do not know whether Bertrand ever actually met with the President. Among Bertrand's musical compositions are: *Anderson March*, 1861, *The National Hymn*, 1861, *The Centennial Presentation Hymn*, 1876, *When He Told me that he Loved Me*, 1882 and *Electric Age March* 1883.
In 1918, Bertrand's son Bernhard rearranged, renamed and republished some of his pieces. *The National Hymn* became *Peace Forever*. *The Centennial Presentation Hymn* became *The Stars and Stripes*. Also republished in 1918 were *Victory Call*, *New National Hymn*, and *Welcome Brave Boys*.
Bertrand is believed to have written The *National Hymn* of 1861 as part of a contest for a new national hymn soon after the Civil War started. The total prize was $500: $250 each to the composer and lyricist. A committee of prominent New Yorkers was formed to review the twelve-hundred submissions that were received. In the end, they didn’t choose any of the submissions and awarded no prize money! The committee didn’t find any of the pieces suitable! Bertrand must have been terribly disappointed.
In addition to his music, Bertrand wrote a play in German (published in 1864) called *Enthüllung, oder Rot, Weiss und Schwarz*. Ein Trauerspiel in 5 Aufzügen. A tragedy in 5 acts. A copy of the play in the NY Public Library at http://catnyp.nypl.org/record=b4767392. 
Hoffacker died in 1892 in New York City.
