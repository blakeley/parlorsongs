**Chauncey Olcott's** (1858 or 1860- 1932) ancestors came from Ireland. His mother was born in Ireland and came to America with her family when she was eight years old. They went first to Montreal, Canada, and then came to Lockport, NY in the 1840's. They lived in what Chauncey Olcott would later call "an Irish shanty" on the banks of the Erie Canal. The "Irish shanty" was located on the east end of West Genesee Street next to a sawmill on the Clifford Lumber Company lumberyard. Newspaper articles concerning Chauncey Olcott's early life are very contradictory. His mother is reported in some articles to be "Margaret Buckley" while other articles say his mother was "Margaret Doyle." One news article reports that his mother married Mellon Whitney Olcott in Lockport, then moved to Buffalo where Chauncey Olcott was born July 21, 1860.(in conflict with other published birth dates) Other articles note Chauncey's birthplace as Lockport. Two years after Mellen Olcott died, Margaret Olcott married Patrick Brennan. Chauncey was Margaret's only surviving son, two others having died. 
It would seem though that Chauncey Olcott was most probably born in Buffalo in 1860. After his death, his widow told of his having taken great delight when they were first married in showing her his birthplace, above his father's stable in Buffalo. His mother's second husband, Patrick Brennan, was Chief Engineer for the Buffalo Water Works for many years. 
Chauncey's mother and stepfather continued to live in Buffalo, and Chauncey attended Buffalo public schools. His early musical traing took place at the Buffalo Academy of Music. His maternal grandmother continued to live in the "Irish shanty" on West Genesee Street where Chauncey would spend his summer vacations from school in Buffalo. Chauncey Olcott's musical career actually began when he was very young. Some Lockport residents recalled times when Chauncey, while visiting in Lockport, was hoisted onto a table at the Washington Hose firehouse on Church Street where he would sing Irish ballads. In 1879, at the age of 19, Chauncey Olcott appeared with Emerson and Hooley's Minstrel Company in Chicago. The next year he joined a group called Haverly's Mastodons at Buffalo, New York, and they opened at the Drury Lane Theatre in London, England. In October 1881, he opened with Billy Emerson's Minstrels in San Francisco. Chauncey was very successful in the minstrel shows, but because of the special quality of his light lyric tenor voice, theatre managers encouraged him to sing Irish ballads and take leading roles in plays, operas and operettas.

In March 1886, Chauncey Olcott made a New York City debut at the Union Square Theatre as Pablo in *Pepita*. Later he starred in The *Old Homestead*, *Pinafore*, and *The Mikado*. In 1890 he went to London where he made stage appearances and studied voice for three years. An accomplished composer, Olcott wrote musical scores for a number of plays including *Minstrel of Clare* (1896), *A Romance in Athlone* (1899) and *Old Limerick Town* (1902).
Despite his tremendous success and stage appearanaces in New York and London and touring extensively, Chauncey Olcott always remembered his NY roots and regularly returned to Lockport for appearances at the Hodge Opera House. In 1900 he appeared in *Eileen Astore*, in 1903 in *Sterrance*; in 1907 it was *Old Limerick Town*, and in 1912 it was *Machusla*.
In 1897, he married Margaret O'Donovan of San Francisco. Margaret Olcott was a co-author of two plays in which her husband appeared, *Ragged Robin* and *Lusmore*. After his death in 1932, she wrote *Song In His Heart*, a biography of Chauncey Olcott. This later was made in a motion picture called appropriately, *My Wild Irish Rose*. She died in 1949, age 70.
In November 1925, while on tour in The Rivals, Chauncey Olcott was stricken with a serious illness and he never appeared on stage again. He retired to Monte Carlo and died there March 18, 1932. At his bedside during his last hours were his wife and his son, Earl Lefevre, and his daughter, Jeannie Olcott. Both son and daughter were adopted. His adopted daughter had been born in Monte Carlo and was 15 years old at the time of Chauncey Olcott's death. His son was an instructor at Heidelberg at the time of his death. According to his obituary, which appeared in the New York Times, Olcott's body would be returned to New York on board the Conte Biancamaro for burial in Woodlawn Cementery.
Other Irish ballads that Chauncey Olcott made famous were *Mother Machree*, *A Little Bit of Heaven, Sure They Call It Ireland*, and *When Irish Eyes Are Smiling*. In many respects, Olcott could fairly be called the father of the Irish ballad in America.
