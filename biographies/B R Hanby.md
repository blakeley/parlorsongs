
**B.(Benjamin) R. Hanby** (1833 - 1867) Popular composer. Graduated from Otterbein University in Westerville Ohio. Served as minister of the United Brethern Church in New Paris, Ohio from 1861 - 63. He worked for a time at the John Church Company in Cincinnati and afterward joined Root & Cady music publishers in Chicago. Among his many popular compositions are: *Adoration* (1866), *Lowliness*, *Ole Shady* and *The song of the Contraband*. Surprisingly, he was the composer of the great "Santa Claus" song, *Up On the House Top*. He was best known for his super hit, *Darling Nelly Gray* (1857), it was the most popular and well known song written by Hanby. In 1856 Hanby sent the song to a music publisher in Boston (Ditson I presume) but never heard back from them. Some months later he noticed his song was a big hit across the nation and wrote to the publisher requesting his royalties. Reflective of the lack of protection for intellectual property of the time, the publisher wrote back to Hanby advising him they had no intention of paying him and that "he had the fame and we have the money and that balanced the account."
