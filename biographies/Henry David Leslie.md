
**Henry David Leslie** (1822 - 1896) Though many American composers were developing during the mid 19th century, much of our music was still deeply rooted in England and to a lesser extent, Europe. Leslie was a very prominent and successful conductor and composer born in London. His parents were John Leslie, a tailor and enthusiastic amateur viola player, and Mary Taylor Leslie. He had eight brothers and sisters. He attended the Palace School in Enfield Town and worked with his father. As a teenager, he studied the cello with Charles Lucas and later played that instrument in concerts at the Sacred Harmonic Society for several years. Leslie began to compose music, and was best known for his large scale choral works (operettas, and oratorios), his conducting and his many successful popular songs.
