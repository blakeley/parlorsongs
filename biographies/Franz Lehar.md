**Franz Lehár** (30 April 1870 - 24 October 1948) was an Austro-Hungarian composer, mainly known for his operettas. Lehár was born in Komárom (Hungary) as the eldest son of a bandmaster in the Austro-Hungarian army. He studied violin and composition but was told by Antonin Dvorak that he had better give up playing and focus on writing music. After 1899 he lived in Vienna. He was also wrote a number of waltzes, the most popular being *Gold und Silber* as well as waltzes drawn from some of his famous operettas. The era in which his music thrived came to be known as the Silver Age.
Among his more famous operettas are; *The Merry Widow* (Die lustige Witwe) (1905), *The Count of Luxembourg* (Der Graf von Luxemburg) (1909), *Frederica* (1928) and *Land of Smiles* (Das Land des Lächelns) (1929). Individual songs from some of these have become standards, notably *Vilja* from The Merry Widow and *You Are My Heart's Delight* ("Dein ist mein ganzes Herz") from *The Land of Smiles*.
