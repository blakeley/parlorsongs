**Fred Fischer** (1875- 1942) was born in Cologne, Germany of American parents. Fisher ran away from home at age 13 and enlisted in the German Navy and later, the French Foreign Legion before coming to the US in 1900. He began composing in 1904 and also wrote the words to many of his songs. His first hit was *If The Man In The Moon Were A Coon* (1905). In 1907, he started his own publishing company with the lyricist of the song *Norway*, Joe Mc Carthy as a partner for a short time. In the 20's Fisher moved to Hollywood and wrote music for silent movies and early sound musicals. Though early in his career he made his name through ethnic songs, later he made something out of geographic topics such as *Norway*, *Siam* (1915)and *Chicago* (1922). Fisher's music endured well into the forties and one of his songs, *Peg O'My Heart* (1913) has become a continuing classic. Fischer wrote it after seeing Laurette Taylor in the Broadway play of the same name and he dedicated it to Taylor. Though a very successful song when published, it was even more successful when it was recorded in 1947 by the Harmonicats and also by Peggy Lee. Sometime around the First World War, Fischer dropped the "c" from his name and used "Fisher" from then on to avoid the stigma of a Germanic name. Known as a contentious, eccentric and excitable person, one of his songs was involved in copyright litigation that continued from 1919 to the 1960's, more than 20 years after his death in NY in 1942. His music is best known for his musical comedic gifts and his ability to make quirky rhythms to highlight creative lyrics.
