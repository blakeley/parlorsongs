
**Cliff Hess** wrote a number of popular works including *When Alexander Takes His Ragtime Band to France* (1918), *Heart Breaking Baby Doll* (1919) and of course *Huckleberry Finn* in 1917. A pianist by trade, he also recorded a number of works on acoustic recordings in the same period as his sonwriting efforts. Aside from that, I've been unable to find much more information about him.
