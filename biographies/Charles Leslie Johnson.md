**Charles Leslie Johnson** was born in Kansas City, Kansas on December 3, 1876. He started taking piano lessons at age six and at sixteen was studying composition and music theory. Incredibly talented, he taught himself to play the violin, banjo, guitar and mandolin. He not only was a composer and performer but also an important patron of the arts in organizing a number of string orchestras. Like many great composers of the times, he was a song plugger early in his career, playing for J.W. Jenkins Sons' Music Company. His first published rag was *Scandalous Thompson*, published by Jenkins in 1899. Later, Johnson was associated with Central Music Publishing and then Carl Hoffman Music Company. While working at Hoffman in 1906, Johnson was working on a new rag when the bookkeeper walked in and asked him what the name of the new work was. Johnson had not named the song yet but noticed the man carrying a carton of dill pickles. Johnson supposedly replied, "I'll call it '*Dill Pickles Rag*.' " After the success of Dill Pickles, Johnson started his own publishing firm which was purchased by Will Rossiter in 1910 with the stipulation that Johnson not re-enter publishing for at least one year. 
Johnson became one of the most prolific composers of the period and expanded his compositions to cover all types of music other than rags. He was published by all of the major firms and was so productive he even resorted to using pseudonyms to make it look like he had a staff of composers working for him. In all, Johnson wrote thirty two rags including *Porcupine Rag* in 1909 and *Blue Goose Rag* in 1913. His biggest money making song was *Sweet and Low* in 1919. Considered a clever and creative composer, Johnson's high sense of humor was often reflected in his works, as it is in *Dill Pickles*. Always a homebody, Johnson stayed in his hometown of KC for his entire life and died there on December 28, 1950.
