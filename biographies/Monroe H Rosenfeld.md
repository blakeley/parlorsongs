
**Monroe H. Rosenfeld** (b. 1861, Richmond, VA - d. 1918, New York) Rosenfeld was more well known as a journalist than a composer and lyricist and his main musical claim to fame was the 1886 song, *Johnnie Get Your Gun*. However, his biggest contribution to America's musical heritage was the naming of Tin Pan Alley. He was the journalist who coined the term while writing a series of articles about America's popular music industry in 1903. His other works include; *Alabama Walk-Around* (1891), *The New Berlin*, *The Virginia Skedaddle* (1892), *Clean Hands and Tainted Gold* (1904) and *A Mother's Lullaby*.
