It seems that most of his lasting works were arrangements rather than outright original composition. He arranged *The Cat Came Back* in 1893 for Harry S. Miller and that same year, *Divorced* with Charles Moreland. We found at least two songs he wrote that were published. In 1891 Bonnell wrote the music for *She's More Than 7* with W.C. Robey's lyrics. In 1892, he wrote *The Man In The Moon May Be Looking* with John A. Fraser Jr. I've been unable to find any biographical data on Bonnell.
