
**Terry Sherman** is credited with several songs from 1912 - 14 but none after or before. I've not found any biographical information. Among his published songs are: *Pawnee Dear* (1913), *By The Old Wishing Well* (1913), *Harmony Bay* (1914) and the *Boogie Man Rag* (1912), published in a rag and song version.
