**Dan Bryant** (1833-1875) Bryant was christened Daniel Webster O'Bryant. He founded the Bryant Minstrel troupe and by the time this song was published had left minstrelsy and had taken to the stage to act in plays. Among the plays he performed in were, Handy Andy, Rory O'More, The Irish Emigrant and (of course) Pat Malloy. Appropriately, all of the plays he performed in had room for a few Irish songs for Bryant to sing. Here is what The New York Times had to say about his performances: July 27, 1865

>"WALLACK's THEATRE. -- Mr., DAN BRYANT's appearance here last evening attracted one of the largest audiences we have ever seen within the walls of this popular establishment Mr. BRYANT is already so great a favorite in another sphere of art, that the audience, reinforced with the lieges thus obtained, was kindly not only to the gentleman himself, but to all his surroundings. As the surroundings were not of the best, they have every reason to be thankful to the lieges. 

>Mr. BRYANT played in two pieces -- the "Irish Emigrant" and "Handy Andy," both of which have previously introduced the gentleman to a dramatic audience. They were played a few months since at the Academy of Music, on the occasion of a complimentary benefit which was tendered to Mr. BRYANT, who, we may now add, displayed then all the geniality that was noticeable in his excellent performance of last evening. We have many Irishmen on the stage, and the best are those who in their impersonations mark certain peculiarities of character in the Hibernian mode of doing and saying things. Mr. BRYANT unquestionably brings a fresh stock of manner and "business" to Irish parts. He is always occupied with the bye-play of the scene, without thrusting himself too prominently upon it, and his bye-play is extremely good. For the rest he speaks a brogue which, if it be open to criticism, is at all events very pleasant, and unusually quiet, genial, humorsome and telling. It is hard to criticize such pieces as the "Irish Emigrant" and "Handy Andy," but we may say that for Summer weather they are acceptable, and peculiarly so when rendered with the heartiness that marked the performance of the principal parts last evening. Mr. DAN BRYANT's success was indeed unmistakable and deserved. It will be his own fault, or the fault of a versatility that leads him into other channels, if he does not speedily become one of the best comedians on the American stage.
