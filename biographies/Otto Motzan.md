
**Otto Motzan** is a little more difficult to find information about. There is some evidence that Motzan was the pen name for composer Josie De Guzman (not to be confused with the currently popular actress of the same name) but I'm unable to find biographical information on either. Besides *In China*, Motzan/DeGuzman wrote the music to the musical *The Passing Show of 1916*, with Sigmund Romberg; *Where Is My Daddy Now Blues*, (1920) with Abe Olman, *Bright Eyes*, (1920) with MK Jerome, *The Traffic Was Terrific* as Josie de Guzman and *Mandy 'N' Me* (1921) with Con Conrad.
