
**Charles Carroll Sawyer** (1833 - ca. 1890) Sawyer's involvement in music was an unlikely happenstance as he was the son of sea captain and shipbuilder (Joshua Sawyer) in Mystic Connecticut. In 1845 at age twelve he moved to New York City and very little is known of his activities there besides being a lyricist for *Weeping Sad and Lonely* and a few other patriotic and war related songs such as *Shake Hands With Uncle Sam* (1866) and *He Was Not Afraid to Die* (1864). Sawyers exact death date is unknown to me at this time. A 1908 reference book simply states he died "after 1890."
