
**J. Fred Helf** was a popular composer during the first two decades of the twentieth century who, like many other successful composers, formed his own publishing company. His company did quite well for several years and published for a number of popular songwrites as well as for his own works. Helf's firm's demise shows the fragility of many of the businesses of that period. In 1910 Helf published *Play That Barbershop Chord*, by Lewis Muir and William Tracey, or at least that is how Helf published it. Songwriter Ballard Macdonald had begun work on the song and had written dummy lyrics before leaving the song behind. The piece was finished by Lewis Muir and William Tracey, and Macdonald was incensed that Helf left his name off the sheet music. He sued Helf successfully, and the award of $37,500 forced Helf into bankruptcy thus ending his foray into publishing. 
Helf also wrote *Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon* (1900, also with Heelan); *Texas Tommy's Dance* (1911); *The Fatal Rose of Red* (1900) and perhaps his greatest title, *If Money Talks, It Ain't On Speaking Terms With Me* ( 1902).
