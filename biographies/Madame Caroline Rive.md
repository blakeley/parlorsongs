Besides this work, I've only found a record of one other song published by her; *The Music of the Foot Fall* (1865), however given her reputation I suspect she wrote many more songs. Interestingly, her daughter Julie Rivé-King born in 1857 gained more fame than the mother as a performer who also studied under Lizst and Reinecke.
