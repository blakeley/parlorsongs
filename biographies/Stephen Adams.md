
**Michael Maybrick** (1844 - 1913) born in Liverpool, England in 1844. He completed his music studies there and moved to 
Leipzig and Milan to study further. He became a well known baritone singer. His first appearance was in the New Philharmonic    Concerts in London in 1870. His songs were popular in both England and America. There is a rather bizarre theory abroad that Maybrick's brother, James may have been the elusive Jack The Ripper. Very few of Maybrick's songs ever reached 
the lasting level of *The Holy City* but a few do survive. Among them are *To The Front*, *The Star Of Bethlehem*, *The Midship Mite* and *Mona*. Maybrick also wrote songs and hymns under the name of Stephen Adams.</p>
