Wenrich, came from a musical family. His mother taught him to play the organ and the piano while he was still a child. A little later, he would write melodies and his father would write the lyrics. Often, his songs were heard at conventions and political rallies. When he was 21 years old, he enrolled in the Chicago Music College, and while there had two of his songs published by a Chicago publisher; *Ashy Africa* and *Just Because I'm From Missouri*. Among his biggest hits were: 1909, *Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet*, lyric Stanley Murphy, 1912 *Moonlight Bay*, lyric by Edward Madden, 1914 *When You Wore A Tulip*, lyric by Jack Mahoney. In 1914 he scored the Broadway show *Crinoline Girl* and in 1921 the Broadway show *The Right Girl*, 1926 the Broadway show *Castles in the Air* and in 1930 scored the Broadway show *Who Cares?*. He was married to the famous performer, Dolly Connelly and performed with her in vaudeville.
