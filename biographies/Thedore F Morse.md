**Theodore F. Morse** (b. 1873, Washington, D.C., d. 1924, New York, N.Y.) was oneof the most important composers of the period before and up to the First World War. He wrote many, many popular songs as well as the scores to several popular stage shows. His wife, Theodora Morse was also an accomplished composer and performer who often composed under the name of Dorothy Terriss. Theodore Morse was a privately tutored student of piano and violin and began his education at the Maryland Military Academy. At age 14 (1887), he ran away from the Academy and went to New York where he became a clerk in a music store. His first song was sold when be was only 15 and by age 24 he had his own publishing house, The Morse Music Co, which was in existence from 1898 to 1900. Morse is well represented on ParlorSongs and has a long list of popular hits to his credit. Among his most famous works are, *Blue Bell* (1904), *M-O-T-H-E-R* (1915), *Down In Jungle Town* (1908) and *Hail, Hail, The Gang's All Here* (1917). In 1903, Morse wrote *Hurray For Baffin Bay* for a new stage show that would become the basis for a blockbuster movie, *The Wizard of Oz*.
