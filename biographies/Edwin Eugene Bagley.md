His most famous march is the National Emblem however many of his marches are still quite popular today and are frequently played at military ceremonies. The tune to the *National Emblem* was used in a novelty song, *And The Monkey Wrapped His Tail Around The Flagpole*. 
Bagley began his music career at the age of nine as a vocalist and comedian with Leavitt’s Bellringers, a company of entertainers that toured many of the larger cities of the United States. He began playing the cornet, traveling for six years with the Swiss Bellringers, after which time he joined Blaisdell’s Orchestra of Concord, New Hampshire. In 1880, he came to Boston as a solo cornetist at the Park Theater. For nine years, he traveled with the Bostonians, an opera company. While with this company, he changed from cornet to trombone. He performed with the Germania Band of Boston and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. By this time he had already composed many marches, including *Front Section*, *The Imperial*, *The Ambassador*, and *America Victorious*. Bagley never took a lesson on any musical instrument. He was also a fine artist who could have made a name for himself as a caricaturist.
