In spite of his rather prodigeous output, little else seems to be documented about him. He primarily was writing during the twenties and thirties. In his early years he worked as a pianist in theater and in music publishing houses. He served in the Arny during WWI and collaborated with a number of popular lyricists during his most prolific period.
