
**Lynn Cowan** is yet another of those elusive composers for whom I've been unable to find any substantial biographical information. There was a Lynn Cowan who performed in a number of film musicals as well as silent films from 1924 to 1934 but I've been unable to make a connection to this composer. Cowan is credited with at least three songs I have found; first, his wonderful 1918 work, *Kisses* with Alex Sullivan, then in 1928 he published *Dream House* with lyrics by Earl Foxe and then in 1929, a song for the film *The Great Gabbo*; *I'm In Love With You* with lyrics by Paul Titsworth.
