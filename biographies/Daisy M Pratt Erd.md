**Daisy M. Pratt Erd**, is listed on most of her works as a Chief Yeoman, USNRF. Interestingly, the F was for "Female." Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels took advantage of the fact that the 1916 law which created the Naval Reserve used the word personnel rather than male when referring to Navy Yeoman and authorized the enlistment of woman as Yeoman (F) on March 19, 1917. Within a month the Navy swore in the first officially recognized enlisted women in U.S. history. The 11,274 Yeoman (F), popularly known as "Yeomanettes", who served in W.W.I were recruited to "Free a Man to Fight". Some of the Yeoman (F) served as chief petty officers but none were commissioned. Daisy Pratt Erd was made Chief Yeoman in charge of women at the Boston Navy Yard with more than 200 women under her supervision and was recommended for an officer’s commission by Congressman James Gallivan but Secretary Daniels explained, "I have no authority to make a woman an ensign and I have given orders that no men shall be made ensigns who do not pass the examinations necessary to qualify them for important duty at sea." Erd wrote several songs during WWI that were designed to instill patriotic responses. Among Them are *The Ships of Uncle Sam* (1918) and *We'll Carry The Star Spangled Banner Through The Trenches* in 1917.
