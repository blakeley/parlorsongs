
**John C. Scherpf** seemed to have made his mark in the musical world primarily as an arranger of music more than an original composer. During the decade of the 1850's a number of works arranged by Scherpf were pubished, many of which were dances. Among the  titles arranged by him are: a quartet version of *Sleeping I Dreamed Love* (Quartett) (seen in our article about music of the 1840's), *The Prima Donna Waltz*, *African quadrilles*, and *Favorite Dances of the Rousset Family*. In a book about music in this decade, Scherpf was cited as a composer, percussionist and secretary of the musical society (of New York).
