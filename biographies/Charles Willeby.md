
**Charles Willeby** (1865 - ??) An Englishman, his songs were popular during the early years of this century; they include titles like *Little pilgrim (A child's fancy)*, published 1907; *Crossing the Bar*, *The Fortune Hunter*, *Summer Rain*, *Autumn Days*, *The Sea Gipsy*, *Coming Home* and *Flower Fetters* plus the cycles *Bow Bells: Five London Silhouettes* and the (three) *Songs of the Madonna*. Willeby was also a music critic and writer and wrote a biographical work about Gilbert & Sullivan circa 1893. In his notes for that work, he commented about one of their less performed works, *The Sorcerer* and said; 
>"the style of the entertainment was so novel, that people did not understand it at first, and the opera was only fairly successful."

Willeby also wrote a Chopin biography, *Frederic Francois Chopin*, published in Edinburgh, 1902. A broadly talented man, Willeby also dabbled in Ragtime, producing at least one Ragtime work, his 1905 *The Silver Lining* using a poem by James Whitcomb Riley.
