
**M. K. Jerome** (1893 - 1977) Jerome began his career in 1911(at 18) working as a song plugger for Waterson, Snyder, and Berlin and broke out in 1918 with *Just A Baby's Prayer At Twilight* which, over the next two years, sold three million copies of sheet music and was the most popular song in America. 
Throughout the 1920s he wrote with many of the men included on our list: Grant Clarke, Sam M.Lewis and Joe Young, Harry Ruby(who he continued to write with in the 1950s) and Bert Kalmar, Fred Ahlert, Harry De Costa and more. Among his other hits during this period were *Jazz Baby*, *Old Pal(Why Don't You Answer Me)* which was recorded by Henry Burr and Al Jolson, *Bright Eyes*(also recorded by Jolson), and which made Billboard's chart for seven weeks in 1921 and *Dream Kisses*, the first song sung by Ginger Rogers on screen.
In 1929, he was part of the first group of song writers chosen by Warner Brothers-Vitaphone to write for their films. He worked there for the next eighteen years and was twice nominated for Oscars for his songs *Some Sunday Morning* and *Sweet Dreams,Sweetheart* (Biography provided by Jerome's grandson, Gary May)
