
**Gustav Luders** (b. Dec. 13,1865 Bremen, Germany d. January 1913, New York, NY.) wrote a fairly large number of musicals and stage plays from the period 1900 to 1913. After a long abscence, he produced one work in 1930 and nothing after that. His work, *Sho-gun* opened October 10, 1904 at Wallack's Theater and ran for 125 performances (Internet Broadway Database). 
Musically trained in Europe, Luders emigrated to Milwaukee, WI, in 1888, when he was 23 years old, and started conducting theater and beer hall orchestras. The eminent composer, Charles K. Harris (*After the Ball*) encouraged him to follow career in music publishing, in Chicago. He found work as an arranger, in the Chicago office of Isidore Witmark Publishing, but also continued to conduct theater orchestras there
In 1899, Luders' first operetta *Little Robinson Crusoe* opened in Chicago. It starred Eddie Foy. Henry W. Savage heard it and commissioned Luders to score the operetta *The Burgomaster*, which also opened in Chicago. At this time, Luders formed a team with Frank Pixley, the editor of the Chicago Times-Herald Newspaper, with Pixley writing text and lyrics.
