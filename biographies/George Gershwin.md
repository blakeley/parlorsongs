**George Gershwin** (1898 - 1937), could rightfully be called the dean of American music for the early 20th century. A composer of prodigeous talents, he wrote some of America's greatest classics for stage as well as large scale works such as his Piano Concerto and *Rhapsody in Blue* for piano and orchestra (1924). His other major works include *An American In Paris* (1928), a tone poem for orchestra that was later used as the basis for a motion picture starring Gene Kelly, and the great American opera, *Porgy and Bess* introduced in Boston in 1935. The number of songs that became popular from his large scale stage works is impressive and unmatched or exceeded by only a few composers. His untimely death in 1937 deprived us of one of the greatest creative musical talents of our modern times.
