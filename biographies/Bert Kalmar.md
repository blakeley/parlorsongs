Though he primarily collaborated with Harry Ruby, he also collaborated with many of the other great songwriters of the period such as Ted Snyder, Oscar Hammerstein II, Con Conrad and Pete Wendling. Kalmar ran away from home at age ten and worked in a travelling tent show as a magician. He performed in vaudeville primarily as a comedian and began writing material for his own and other performers. He was quite unsuccessful at writing songs till he met Ruby and they began working together. Some of his best known hits include, *Oh! What A Pal Was Mary*, *Who's Sorry Now?*, *I Wanna Be Loved By You* and *Three Little Words*. Kalmar's success as a lyricist also brought him into the Broadway show business and he wrote the scores for a number of very successful shows including *Helen Of Troy New York* (1923) and *Animal Crackers* (1928). He also wrote scores for movies, his most memorable being *Check and Double Check* starring Amos and Andy. One song from that film, *Three Little Words*, is considered by most to be his greatest hit. His last song, *A Kiss To Build A Dream On* became popular four years after his death after it appeared in the 1951 film, *The Strip*. (basic facts from kinkle, V.2, p.p. 1217-18 and Claghorn, p. 247)
