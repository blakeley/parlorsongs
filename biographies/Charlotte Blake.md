Remick, proprietor of the Whitney Warner Publishing Co., in Detroit, MI. Throughout this period she lived with her family at the home address of Edward C. Blake, who headed up a truly traditional Michigan enterprise: E. C. Blake & Co., "Dealers in Raw and Dressed Furs." In the city directories, Charlotte Blake was simply identified as a "pianist" or "clerk," but in fact she composed over 35 titles for Remick including syncopated pieces, rags, novelettes, waltzes, and songs, several of which received top billing in Remick's advertising campaigns. At first she was referred to as "C. Blake, composer of 'Missouri Mule,' etc." but by 1906 the Remick ads revealed her full name. 

For example: 

"Dainty Dames" Novelette: This beautiful, little, dainty semi-classic by Charlotte Blake stands out prominently with the very best class of leaders and is played continuously. It is called a Novelette and certainly is novel in every sense of the word, and exceedingly melodious. Especially adapted for Theatre and Concert work and is a most catchy Schottische. In 1911 Remick published three songs plus an instrumental rag, which received this amusing review: 

"With "rags" in general we are at enmity, and we pour out the vials of
our wrath on the ragger who invented rag. But seeing that "rags" are on
the market we must acknowledge them. As a sample of this peculiar kink,
Charlotte Blake's "That Tired Rag'" is as good as any of them."
[American Musician & Art Journal, Mar. 25, 1911, p. 18] 

After 1919 Charlotte Blake seems to have abandoned her composing career. 
She continued living with her family in the Detroit area at least through the early 1930s and apparently never married. Eventually she moved to Santa Monica, California where she died in 1979 at age 94.
