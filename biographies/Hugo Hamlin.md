
*Hugo Hamlin* Though I've been unable to find only two songs by him, here is what little we do know. Hamlin was born in 1884 and passed away in 1951. Hamlin moved to early Hollywood to produce stage productions and to create a line of girls similar to the 'Rocketts' of Radio City Music Hall. Hugo Hamlin produced all of the stage productions at Grauman's Chinese Theater prior to movies taking over. He originally lived in and around Boston, Cambridge and Salem. And that at some point he went to New York before coming to California. Besides *Decoration Day* I did find one other title attributed to Hamlin, *I'm Going Back To Chattanooga Tennesee* published in 1913.
