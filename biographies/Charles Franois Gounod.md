**Charles François Gounod** ( b. Paris, 1818 - d. Paris, 1893) was the son of a talented painter who had won some acclaim but died when Gounod was four. Gounod's mother was a pianist who gave young Charles his early musical education. He learned classical studies at the Lycée St. Louis and studied music under Anton Reicha when in 1836 he entered the prestigious Paris Conservatoire. There he received instruction from some of the greatest musicians of the times. Gounod won the coveted Prix de Rome three years later. In 1839, he traveled to Rome where he was deeply impressed by the polyphonic music he heard sung in the Sistine Chapel. He then began a serious study of 16th century sacred music. It was in the area of liturgical music that Gounod excelled throughout his life. Arguably, his greatest work is the *Messe solennelle de Saint Cècile*, first performed in 1855. Considered a masterpiece, it established his successful style of ornate and elaborate work that was in contrast to his earlier, more austere work.
In 1842 he traveled to Vienna and then on to Berlin where he was exposed to the music of the area and also received a commission to compose two masses. His experience there made him unique among French composers in that he had a deep knowledge of music, past and present that went beyond the current French traditions and operatic style. Gounod returned to Paris in 1843 to accept his first position as organist at the Missions Etrangères and soon was at odds with a congregation who disliked his steady diet of Bach and 16th century music. Gounod seemed to understand that opera was a key to success for a French composer. As such, he turned to composing opera and his first, *Sapho* premièred in 1851. Unfortunately, in spite of compliments from renowned composers such as Berlioz, it was a failure. He followed Sapho with several other works that fared no better. 
Thereafter followed a period of opera production where Gounod met with much better success than he had earlier. Gounod produced *Le Medecin malgré lui* in 1858 and then *Philémon* in 1860. These successes, combined with *Faust* in 1859, earned Gounod a place as perhaps the most acclaimed composer in France. Like Mascagni (Ave Maria*) Gounod was to spend the rest of his life in pursuit of an opera as well received as Faust. Though he produced many more, none enjoyed the popularity of *Faust*.
In the last years of his life, Gounod returned to religious music. He became very successful in England and as such, he had a strong influence on choral music there. It was Gounod's belief that France was a country of "precision, neatness and taste, that is to say, the opposite of excess, pretentiousness, disproportion and longwindedness"
It is in this sense, a master of a refined and precisely restricted style, that he is now regarded.
