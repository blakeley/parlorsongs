His first published song was *Down In Dear New Orleans* in 1912. He was a partner in a publishing firm, The Broadway Music Corporation, with Henry Waterson (later of Berlin, Waterson & Snider) and by 1918 was associated with other publishers, including Shapiro Bernstein. Conrad's 1920 hit *Margie* was a resounding hit and established Conrad as a major songwriter of the era. *Margie* was written for Eddie cantor and the name came from Cantor's five year old daughter. Cantor introduced the song at the Winter Garden and later included it in the 1921 revue, *The Midnight Rounders*. Conrad wrote a number of other big hits from 1920 through the 30's till his death. Some of his big hits included, *Barney Google*, 1923 with Billy Rose , *Ma! (He's Making Eyes At Me)*, 1921 and *Prisoner of Love* in 1931.
