**Clara M. Brinkerhoff** (1830 - ?) Born Clara M. Rolph in London, was a music teacher, soprano vocalist and translator. She performed actively in New York from 1855 to 1860. Brinkerhoff translated musical reviews from French and Spanish for the New York Musical World. The famous composer and pianist Louis Gottschalk composed a piece for her to sing as did several other notable composers of the day. Interestingly, during this same general era, another woman with the identical name was an inventor of telegraphic equipment improvements. I've had some difficulty finding other titles by Brinkerhoff but among those I could find were; *Darling I am Sad*, *One Flag or no Flag* (1864) and *Charley*, or, *A Mother's Fears*, and *Romanza* (1864)
