**George Evans** (b. 1870, Wales - d. 1915, Baltimore) Evans' family brought him to the US at age seven. He became a performer before he was a composer. Known as a blackface minstrel, he starred in Lew Docstader's Minstrels at one point in his career. According to histories, Evans was well known for his comedic routines which he also performed on vaudeville. In 1894 Evans wrote the song *I'll Be True To My Honey Boy* which became quite popular and resulted in him gaining the permanent nickname of Honey Boy. Some of his compositions are still well remembered and have become classic "gay 90's style songs. Almost all of his songs were in collaboration with Ren Shields. Among them are *In The Good Old Summertime* (1902), *In The Merry Month of May* (1903), *Come Take a Trip In My Air-Ship* (1904), *You'll Have to Wait Till My Ship Comes In* (1906) and *Waltzing With The Girl You Love* (1905).
