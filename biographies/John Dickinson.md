**John Dickinson** (1732 - 1808) is perhaps one of the least likely people you would expect to have been a songwriter. One of America's founding fathers and a signatory of the Declaration of Independence, Dickinson is more remembered for his contributions to the building of our country than as a songwriter. His family were English, having settled in the seventeenth century in Maryland; Dickinson himself was born in Talbot County, on November 8, 1732. He grew up at Poplar Hall, the elegant brick mansion of his father, Judge Samuel Dickinson. His initial education consisted of private tutelage but later his parents sent him to London for a proper education. In London he studied law and returned home to practice law in Philadelphia. It was at this time he became involved in politics and was elected to the Pennsylvania Assembly. He distinguished himself in the Assembly, siding with the Proprietary party against the faction led by Benjamin Franklin that sought to turn Pennsylvania from a commonwealth governed by the Penn family to a colony immediately under Royal control. Dickinson, eloquent and stubborn, stood his ground and kept his standing in Philadelphia society. 
Later, elected to the Continental Congress, Dickinson proved his skill in drafting declarations in the name of the Congress. One notable one was written with Thomas Jefferson, *Declaration on the Causes and Necessity of Taking up Arms*, with a conclusion that Americans were �resolved to die freemen rather than live slaves.� When Richard Henry Lee proposed a declaration on independence, Dickinson opposed it, saying the timing was bad. Dickinson suggested the colonies form a confederation amongst themselves before declaring independence from the Crown. While Jefferson, Franklin, John Adams, and others were appointed to a committee to draft a Declaration of Independence, Dickinson, Roger Sherman, and others were put on a committee to draw up Articles of Confederation. The document Dickinson prepared was heavily amended and revised before being accepted by the full Congress. 
When the war began, Dickinson enlisted as a private in the Continental Army, having been a colonel in the provincial militia. Dickinson�s company served under General Caesar Rodney, notably at the Battle of Brandywine. In 1781 Dickinson was elected president of Delaware; the next year he resigned that post to be elected president of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania. While Dickinson was president of Pennsylvania, his old colleague from the Congress, Benjamin Rush, suggested founding a new college in Cumberland County. Rush approached Dickinson about naming the new college �John and Mary�s College,� in honor of the president and his lady. Dickinson, appalled at the parallel with William and Mary, demurred, saying that the new Republic should avoid allusions to monarchy. Rush won approval for calling the college �Dickinson.� 
The 1790s saw Dickinson in retirement, living with his wife and two daughters in a townhouse in Wilmington, Delaware. John Dickinson died February 14, 1808, at his home in Wilmington. President Jefferson expressed his sorrow, and both houses of Congress resolved to wear black armbands in mourning. He was buried in the cemetery of the Friends Meeting House, Wilmington.
