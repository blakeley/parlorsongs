As with so many continental composers, Felix emmigrated to the US to bring his talents to the burgeoning stage musical industry. His first contribution here was a remake of a 1902 Berlin work, *Madame Sherry* which he rewrote and staged in New York in 1910. Quickly learning the American idiom, he went on to stage at least six other shows including *Tantalizing Tommy* (1912), *Pom-pom* (1916), *Lassie* (1920), *The Sweetheart Shop* (1920), *Sancho Panza* (1923) and his apparently final Broadway production, *Peg-O'-My-Dreams* in 1924.
