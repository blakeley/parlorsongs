Oct 22, 1936 Beverly Hills ) I add this entry and vent, as I often have about the infuriating loss of information about so many woman composers from America's past. It often seems that we can find information on some of the least significant, sometimes inept male composers while women of prodigeous talent are ignored. None of my references provide any biographical information for Ms. Caldwell and what a loss that is for all of us. I do know that she wrote a number of books and lyrics for Hugo Felix and other composers. In fact, her credits include many more works than Felix, as many as twenty-seven productions yet she has been virtually ignored. Among her many credits (having written the book and lyrics and in some cases the music as well!) are; *The Top o' th' World*, she composed the music for this musical show in 1907, *The Nest Egg*, an original play(1910), *The Lady of the Slipper* (1912), *Chin Chin* (1914), *The Lady in Red* (1919), *Hitchy-Koo* (1920), *The Magnolia Lady* (1924), *Take the Air* (1927) and *Three Cheers* (1928). A 1975 (39 years after her death) revival of *Very Good Eddie* included song lyrics from some of her prior works.
