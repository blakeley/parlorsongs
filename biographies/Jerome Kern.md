**Jerome Kern** (b. Jan. 27, 1885, New York City, d. Nov. 11, 1945, New York City) Kern was one of the most important pioneering composers of American Popular Song, Jerome Kern was writing for Broadway shows in 1904 (age 19). He wrote his first complete score for a Broadway musical in 191l. The Kern/Hammerstein score for the musical *Showboat* was a landmark in the Broadway theater. He starting writing for Hollywood as early as 1935. After his last Broadway show *Very Warm For May*, Kern wrote exclusively for motion pictures. During 1913, Kern and other composers and lyricists were experimenting, in the small Princess Theater in New York, with American subjects for musicals. Kern's first big hit was *They Didn't Believe Me* from the 1914 show *The Girl from Utah*. In 1919, Kern had a minor hit with the song *Ka-Lu-A*, with lyric by Anne Caldwell. The huge success of that year was the song *Dardanella*. Kern used the bass line of *Dardanella* in his *Ka-lu-a*, and the publishers of *Dardanella* sued him. The case went all the way to the Supreme Court where Kern eventually lost. (He was never accused of plagiarizing the melody, only of using the Bass Line.) That case was a landmark for copyright interpretation and protection. Several other hit shows followed in the late 1910's and twenties before his biggest hit musical Showboat. By the end of the thirties Kern had composed his last Broadway musical. 
The son of an upper-middle class new York family, Jerome studied at Heidleberg University in Germany, returning to the U.S. with a Master of Music degree. His first published song appeared in a Broadway show, *Silver Slipper*. Jerome was 19 years old at the time. During the next eight years, he had melodies in over 24 Broadway shows before having his first big hit *They Didn't Believe Me* from the 1914 show *The Girl From Utah*. 
In the 1920's, he wrote material for many shows, but his greatest achievement came with 1927's *Show Boat*, one of the finest shows Broadway has ever produced. By this time, he had already written such songs as *Look For The Silver Lining*, *Ol' Man River*, *Only Make Believe*, and *Smoke Gets in Your Eyes*. In 1932, he wrote *The Song Is You* with Oscar Hammerstein for the Broadway show *Music In The Air*. That same year he signed with RKO Pictures for the films *Roberta* and, in 1936, *Swingtime* with it's twin hits of *The Way You Look Tonight* and *A Fine Romance*, both sung by Fred Astaire. His last Broadway show was in 1939 *Very Warm For May*.
