
**C. Lucky (Charles Luckeyeth) Roberts** (1841-1968) was a black pianist bandleader and composer. His band was a major presence in the 1920's and he performed at Carnegie Hall in 1936. He later had a club in Harlem. Billy Boy is a rare work by him as he is best known for his rags and jazzy songs. The war and the bravery of the 369th in the War inspired Roberts to write a song to honor Mitchell and the men of the regiment. Among his better known works are; *Junk Man Rag* (1913), *Pork and Beans* (1913), *Music Box Rag* (1914), *Helter Skelter* (1915), *Railroad Blues* (1920) and *M'lasses* (1923). Roberts also wrote several concert works including a suite for orchestra and a rhapsody for piano and orchestra.
