**Harry Ruby** (1895 - 1959) was born in New York in 1895. He began his career as a pianist in cafes and vaudeville and worked as a song plugger for several publishers, including Von Tilzer and Gus Edwards. He performed as a part of a vaudeville act called Edwards & Ruby. His primary lyricist partner throughout his career was Burt Kalmar (1884 -1947) however he also often teamed with Edgar Leslie. In addition to writing hundreds of popular songs with Kalmar, they also collaborated on several stage works and film scores. Their most notable film scores included the Marx Brother's hit *Duck Soup* in 1933. They also wrote the music for the Marx brothers' stage production of *Animal Crackers* in 1928.
Some of Ruby's greatest hits are; *Timbuctoo*, *My Sunny Tennessee*, *I Wanna be Loved By You* and *Hooray for Captain Spaulding*. What? You say you neverheard of Hooray For Captain Spaulding? I'll bet you heard it many times if you were born before 1960. That song was the theme song of Groucho Marx for many years.
