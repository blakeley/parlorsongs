**Shelton Brooks** ( b.1886, Amesburg, Ontario, Canada d. 1975.) A child of Native American and Black parents, Brooks learned his keyboard skills on the family pump organ. His father was a Preacher, and Shelton and his brother would play the organ at services. (Shelton played, and his older brother pumped the Bellows pedals which Shelton couldn't reach.) His family emigrated to Detroit, and the 15 year old Shelton made some appearances as a child prodigy. In time, he became a cafe pianist, and a very famous black performer. He performed as a pianist, playing Ragtime around 1909 and began his composing career with mainly Ragtime numbers. 

Shelton wrote his first big hit in 1910, *Some of These Days* with his own lyrics. He had already introduced the song in his own vaudeville act, when Sophie Tucker's maid, introduced both him and the tune to Sophie. Tucker loved it and she made it her theme song. Brooks also tried his hand at performing is stage roles such as *Plantation* (1922), *Dixie To Broadway* (1924), and Ken Murray's *Blackouts of 1949*. Perhaps Brook's best known hit was his 1917, hit The *Darktown Strutter's Ball*. Among hos other great songs were *Walkin' The Dog*, *There'll Come A Time* and *Jean*. Brooks enjoyed a long recording career as well. Many of his recordings were comedic for example the Okeah record 4632 carried the titles, *Collecting Rents* and *Chicken Thieves* both comedy skits, not songs. Shelton died on On September 6, 1975.
