
**Edward I. Boyle** I've found little about Boyle but for one very intriguing statement calling him the " Celebrated Blind Entertainer" and two other titles besides *Roguish Rosie Ray* by him, *A Ride in a Jitney For Mine* (1915) and *Jimmie Boy* (1918). Surely there is a story worth finding and preserving about this man but unfortunately, I've had no luck finding it.
