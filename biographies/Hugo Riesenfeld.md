
**Hugo Riesenfeld** (1879 - 1939) "From 1917-1925, Riesenfeld was the manager of the Rivoli, Rialto and Criterion Theatres in New York. A conductor and violinst, Riesenfeld was educated at the Conservatory of Music in Vienna and the University of Vienna, he then conducted with the Imperial Opera House in Vienna. In 1907 he came to America with Oscar Hammerstein and for four years worked with the Manhattan Opera Company in New York. While on Broadway, Riesenfeld demonstrated the entertainment and box office possibilities of having intelligent music accompany films. In 1928, Hugo was appointed general musical director in charge of musical productions for United Artists Pictures." (Preceeding biographical sketch written by Tony Luke Scott from his book The Stars of Hollywood Forever, reprinted with permission from the author.) 
Riesenfeld wrote only one Broadway musical, *Betty Be Good* however, as a film score writer he was incredibly productive. In all he wrote scores for over 100 films. Some of his film credits occurred 40 years after his death through the re-use of prior scores from earlier works. His impressive list of scores includes *The Ten Commandments* (1923), *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* (1923), *King of Kings* (1928), *The Iron Mask* (1929), *Tarzan The Fearless* (1933), *Dick Tracy* (1937) and *Dick Tracy Returns* in 1938. He continued writing up to his death.
