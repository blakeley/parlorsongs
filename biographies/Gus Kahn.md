
**Gus Kahn** (1886 - 1941) is one of America's greatest lyricists. Born in Coblenz, Germany, his family came to the USA and settled in Chicago in 1891. He worked mostly in non-music related jobs but persisted in seeking outlets for his song lyrics. His first song was published in 1907 and after that, he concentrated on writing lyrics for vaudeville performers in Chicago first, then in New York in the 1920's. In 1933, he moved to California and focused on writing for movies. The many eminent composers he teamed with over his long career include, Isham Jones, Walter Donaldson (*My Buddy*) , Egbert Van Alstyne, George Gershwin and Ernie Erdman (*Toot -Toot -Tootsie*). Many of his songs have become standards with *Pretty Baby* (1916) being perhaps the most notable. Other standards by Kahn include, *Carolina In The Morning* (1922), *Makin' Whoopee*, 1928 and *Liza* (1928). His movie biography, *I'll See You In My Dreams* (1951) starring Danny Thomas and Doris Day is an engrossing story that is filled with many of his hits. Kahn died in Beverly Hills in 1941.
