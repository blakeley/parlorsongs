**Bernard Eyges** (1893 - 1994) Shown here at the piano with his band, circa 1925, Eyges came to America with his parents (who had first emmigrated to England, where Bernard was born) in 1902. An industrious lad, Bernard worked his way through college in Boston by playing piano, singing and writing his own songs. Around 1923, he formed a band called Bernie's Bunch and managed get his group a gig on WGI, Boston's first radio station. Bernard realized that radio was one way to gain a larger audience and he was right; the group became quite popular. Unfortunately, in 1925 WGI went bankrupt and Bernie's Bunch found themselves unemployed. The members of the band went their separate ways and Bernard was hired to sing on another station, WNAC, first as a solo act and later as a duo with Jack Flynn. In 1926, Bernard formed another group, the "Eyges Entertainers." This group performed on Boston's WNAC from 1926 to 27. Bernard married his dear Jennie about this time and they started a family. Eyges was actually a lawyer by schooling and began to spend more time on being a lawyer to suppport his family. He continued to perform in and around Boston at various clubs with the "Bernard Eyges Orchestra" on weekends well into the 1930's. He ultimately abandoned his musical career to devote himself to his legal career. Besides his *Woodlad Rose* in 1918, he wrote other songs with lyricist Robert Levenson, including the 1925 *Drifting 'Neath the Silver Moon*. Eyges died in 1994 at the mature age of 101!
