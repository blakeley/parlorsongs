
**Ballard MacDonald** (1882 - 1935) was born in Portland Oregon. He was educated at Princeton and became best known as a lyricist who collaborated with some of the greatest Tin Pan Alley composers of the period. His best known works are *The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine*, writtten in 1913 with Harry Carrol and *Back Home Again In Indiana* with James M. Hanley, 1917. He also wrote *Play that Barber Shop Chord* in 1910 which resulted in an interesting court case. In 1910, publisher/composer Fred Helf published *Play That Barbershop Chord*, by Lewis Muir and William Tracey, or at least that is how Helf published it. Songwriter Ballard Macdonald had begun work on the song and had written dummy lyrics before leaving the song behind. The piece was finished by Lewis Muir and William Tracey, and Macdonald was incensed that Helf left his name off the sheet music. He sued Helf successfully, and the award of $37,500 forced Helf into bankruptcy thus ending his foray into publishing. MacDonald died in Forest Hills, New York in 1935
