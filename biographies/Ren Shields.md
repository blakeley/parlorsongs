**Ren Shields** (b. 1868, Chicago, IL - d. 1913, Massapequa, NY) Shields started his career as have many songwriters as a youth in minstrel shows and vaudeville. He sang as a part of the Empire State Quartet in vaudeville from 1890 - 1894 and also performed with Max Million beginning in 1894. Somewhere along the way, Shields met George Evans, composer and fellow vaudevillian and the two collaborated on a number of songs many of which are still remembered more than a century later. Among his hit lyrics are; *In The Good Old Summertime* (1902), *In The Merry Month of May* (1903), *Come Take a Trip In My Air-Ship* (1904), *Steamboat Bill* (1910, and *Waltzing With The One You Love* (1905).
