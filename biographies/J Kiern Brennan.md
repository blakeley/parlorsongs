
**J. Kiern Brennan** ( b. 1873, San Francisco, d. 1948, Hollywood) began his musical career as a vaudevillian singer and turned to writing lyrics. His biggest hit was *A Little Bit Of Heaven, Sure They Call It Ireland*, written for the stage show *The Heart Of Paddy Wack* in 1914. The music for that song was by Ernest R. Ball and with that start, the two teamed for a long line of songs that were popular and lasting hits. Though Ball did write some songs on his own and a few with other lyricists, Brennan in generally considered to be Ball's chief lyricist. As a youth, Brennan worked as a cowboy and took part in the Klondike gold rush. He worked as a singer in a number of Chicago publishing houses and also wrote a number of stage show scores including *White Lilacs* (1928), *Boom! Boom!* (1929) and *Luana* (1929). In 1929, he focused his efforts on writing songs for Hollywood.
