Körner who later was one of his primary publishers along with G. A. Spina, music publishers in Vienna. Jungmann moved to Italy and was professor of music at the St. Cecilia Acadamy in Rome for some time. He returned to Vienna in 1853. Jungmann also managed one publishing house, Diabella & Co and ultimately succeeded Spina as owner and he changed the publishing house's name to Jungmann and Lerch. He wrote hundreds of salon pieces for piano. His music was quite popular due to its melodiousness and practical technique. He composed some songs and orchestral music but it seems his piano work *Heimweh*, is his most remembered work.
