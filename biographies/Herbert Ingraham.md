
**Herbert Ingraham** (1883 - 1910) has fared somewhat better over time and we do know a little about him. Ingraham was born in Aurora, Illinois in 1893 and was considered a musical prodigy early in life. As a child he conducted his own theatrical company and organized an orchestra in Chicago. He moved to New York and became a staff composer for Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. and was on his way to spectacular success when he contracted tuberculosis and he died at only 27. In the last year of his life, he had several hits including, *All That I Ask Of You Is Love*, *You Are The Ideal of My Dreams* and *Good-by Rose*. *Roses Bring Dreams of You* was one of his greatest hits and a couple of comedy songs; *Because I'm Married* and *Hoo-oo! Ain't You Coming Out Tonight*? His untimely death ended a very promising career.
