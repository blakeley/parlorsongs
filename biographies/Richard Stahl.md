
**Richard Stahl** seemed to have flourished from about 1881 to 1900 or so for that is the only period from which I can find works he published. None of his biographical information seems available through our library and the nest. Here are a few of the woks he published; *President James A. Garfield's Grand Inauguration March* (1881), *Lillian Russell Waltz* (1883), *I've Spent My Last Dime* (1883), *The Pretty Girl Across the Street* (1893), *My First and Only Love Song* (1896) and *Mary Jane Marie* (1897).
