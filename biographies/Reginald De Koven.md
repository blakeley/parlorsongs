**Reginald De Koven** (b. Middletown, CT, 1859 - d. Chicago, IL, 1920) was a prominent composer and with Harry B. Smith(b. 1860, Buffalo, NY, d. 1936, Atlantic City, NJ) as librettist, wrote an operetta as well as a large number of others including *Don Quixote* in 1889, *Robin Hood*, (1890), *Rob Roy*, (1894) and *The Highwaymen*, (1897). His most famous song is *Oh Promise Me* from Robin Hood. De Koven was also the conductor of the Washington,DC Philharmonic orchestra from 1902 -05. Smith also was librettist for the great Victor Herbert and collaborated with a number of other songwriters of the period. He was responsible for a number of hits including the novelty song, *A Woman Is Only A Woman, But A Good Cigar Is A Smoke*. I'll bet he made a lot of female friends with that winner! 
De Koven was musically trained in Europe and was a graduate of Oxford. In 1827 he travelled to Europe and studied piano and composition in Stuttgart. He earned his degree at Oxford in 1879. During his time there he also studied with Von Supp�, Felibes, Gen�e and Vanuccini, all operatic composers. In 1882 he returned to the US and was employed primarily as a music critic with Harper's Weekly, The New York World, Herald and Journal and the Chicago Evening Post from around 1889 to 1912. He founded and conducted the Washington (DC) Symphony Orchestra in 1902. 
At the same time he was writing and conducting, DeKoven was composing well over 400 songs, orchestral works, sonatas, ballets and two grand operas, most of which have faded into obscurity. It is *Robin Hood* though, his operetta set in Europe that dominated DeKoven's popularity. His music draws on both traditional opera as well as folk melodies. Banking on the success of *Robin Hood*, de Koven later produced *Rob Roy* (1896), *The Highwayman* (1897) and *Maid Marian* in 1901. None of them ever rose to the popularity of *Robin Hood*.
