Widowed in 1864, she made a good living for herself and her family composing and performing. She wrote songs from gospel, temperance, Sunday school songs and patriotic and we have many songs by her from the period in our collection. Her music was written in the style of the most popular composers of the period such as Foster and was a huge success. She most likely is the mpost prolific and important woman composer of the period. Unfortunately, because she was a woman, her legacy has failed to reach the recognition or praise of the likes of Foster. Though she wrote in the period style, her music cannot in any way be viewed as "copycat.' She showed a great deal of creativity both musically and in subject and was exceptionally well known at the time. Besides songs, she also wrote piano works such as a set of variations on the tune *Yankee Doodle*. Among her many songs written during the war, a number were written the same year as *Dey Said We Wouldn't Fight* including; *Our Dear New England Boys* (1864); *Richmond Is Ours* (1864), *The Soldier's Dying Farewell* (1864) and *No Slave Beneath That Starry Flag* (1864). After the war she continued to espouse the black people's cause with songs such as *The Freedman's Lament* (1866).
