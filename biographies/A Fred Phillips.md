
**A. Fred Phillips** is yet another of the many "missing in action" composers from the early 20th century golden age of song, there is virtually no information available on him other than listings for three of his songs, the present one, *Got Her Off My Hands But Can't Get Her Out Of My Mind* from1951, and popularized by the Mills Brothers and *Got The Bench, Got The Park But I Haven't Got You* from 1931. It seems he wrote a song every twenty years or so. He also seemed to have a penchant for long titles. It seems his partner in writing this son, Richard Howard, has suffered the same fate with only three songs to his credit and little else about him to be found. His works include *Face To Face With The Girl Of My Dreams*, 1914 and *When The Leaves Come Tumbling Down*, 1922.
