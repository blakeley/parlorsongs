
**Dorothy Forster** (1884-1950) Is thought to have lived in England & though little else has been found at this time, she is another of our many enigmatic woman composers from the Tin Pan Alley era. We do know she published a number of works including; *A Love Remembered Not*, *Bird of June*, *Dearest, I Bring You Daffodils*, *I'll Tell The Sunshine*, *Little Rose of Love*, *Margaret*, 
*Mifanwy*, *Rose in the Bud* (1907), *Since You Came Back*, *The Happy Hills*, *The Little Rose-Clad Window*, *Love's First Kiss* (words by Edward Lockton) and *Sing Joyous Bird* (a title used by a number of different composers) which was recorded on a CD some years ago. One reason biographical data for many of these women composers cannot be "found" is that many either chose to write under pseudonyms or changed their names due to marriage or unmarriage.
