I've been unable to find very little information about him in my references or on the web. However, we do know of some other works in addition to *The Land Of Make Believe* by him, all of which also have fabulous covers. Among them are; *Girl of Mine* (1919), *Just a Girl Like You* (1919), *Day Dreams of You* (1928), *It's a Long Way From Berlin to Broadway* (1917) and *Virginia Moonlight* (1920). Freeman formed his own publishing house probably in 1919 as the title *Girl Of Mine* was published by A.J. Stasny yet all other 1919 works and those beyond were published by Freeman's house. Given Freeman's reasonably large output and the fact that he had a major publishing house, I find it quite odd that little else is said about him in numerous books about Tin Pan Alley.
