
**James Brockman** (1886 - 1967) studied music at the Cleveland conservatory and early in his career was a comedian in stage musicals. His most lasting hit, *I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles* was introduced by June Caprice in the *Passing Show of 1918*. Among his other hits were, *Down Among The Sheltering Palms*, *Feather Your Nest* and the great novelty song, *I Faw Down An' Go Boom*. Brockman had a long and successful career, turning to film scores later in his life. His partner, James Kendis (b. 1883, St. Paul, MN, d. 1946, Jamaica, NY) had some of his greatest success in his collaborations with Brockman. Kendis formed his own publishing company, Kendis Music Company. Some of his other hits not collaborated with Brockman include, *If I Had My Way*, *Angel Eyes*, and *Come Out Of The Kitchen, Mary Ann*.
