**Lee Orean Smith** (dates ??) Though I have several works that are attributed to Smith either as primary composer or arranger, I've been unable to find much of anything about his life or contribution to American music. The photo is from the cover of the 1902 Star Dance Folio Nr. 2. That folio of songs was arranged by Smith for publication by Shapiro, Bernstein & Co. In addition, there are several other folios I have, including the Albert Von Tilzer collection from 1905, The Star Dance Folio Nr. 1 from 1901 and the Crown Dance Folio from 1903 published by Sol Bloom. Among his original works are *Campin' On De Ole Suwanee* (1899), *King Crap* (1900), *Anona* (1903), *The Old Wedding Gown* (1913) and *La Flor del Amazona* (1914).
