Polla was a profific composer writing a large number of popular songs and several ragtime works as well as some orchestral works. Most of his rags were written under the pseudonym "W.C. Powell." One wonders why, unless he somehow felt that he did not want to mix his classical and heart songs side with a rather coarse and wild ragtime persona. Many of his works were graced with beautiful woman covers, several by the now famous "pinup" artist, Rolf Armstrong whose early 20th century portraits are among the best female portraits ever. As with many successful composers, Polla also owned his own publishing house, the W.C. Polla Company, for a few years. Among his works are; *Gondolier, The* (1903), *Missouri Rag* (as W.C. Powell 1907), *Johnny Jump Up* (as WC Powell 1910), *Dope Rag* (as W. C. Powell 1909), *Dancing Tambourine* (1927), *Night In June* (1927), *You Know* (1919), *Mama's Gone Goodbye* (1924), *Funny Folks* (as W. C. Powell), *Dear Heart* (1919 ), *Drifting* (1920), *My Castles in the Air are Tumbling Down* (1919) and *My Sunshine Rose* (1920)
