
**Benny Davis** (1895 - 1979) Davis was primarily a lyricist having written some of Tin Pan Alley's greatest hits. His earliest start in the music business was at age 14 touring with Benny Fields' Tours as an accompanist to Blossom Seeley. He later focused almost entirely on writing lyrics after writing the smash hit *Margie* in 1920 with Con Conrad. He collaborated with some of the greatest composers of the era including Milton Ager, J. Russel Robinson, Billy Baskette and Harry Akst. He wrote the lyrics for several Broadway productions including *Artists and Models of 1927*, *Sons o’ Guns* and three editions of Cotton Club revues. Davis' output was prodigeous and resulted in one of the largest catalogs of credits from that era. Many of Davis' songs were performed in motion pictures and his film credits include older as well as some very recent films including *The Cotton Club*, The *Lady In Red* and *Son of Mask*. His hit songs include; *Goodbye Broadway, Hello France* (1917), *Margie* (1920), *Angel Child* (1922), *Baby Face* (1926), *I Still Get A Thrill* (1930), *Chasing Shadows* (1935), *All I Need Is You* (1942) and his last, *Follow The Boys* (1963). Davis was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1975.
