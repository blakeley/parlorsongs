**Bret Harte** was one of America's greatest "western" authors. Though New York born (Albany 1839), his family moved to California in 1854 where he worked in a number of jobs from miner to journalist. It was there he met Mark Twain and other notable writers of the period. While working for the Overland Monthly as editor, Harte wrote a short story titled *The Luck of The Roaring Camp* which immediately became popular. He wrote a number of other stories about the American West as well as poetry, and at least this one song lyric. Harte returned to New York in 1871 and in 1878 was appointed U.S. Consul in Germany. In 1880 he moved to Scotland and later to London where he died in 1902. (Image & biographical source material http://www.zpub.com/sf/history/harte.html )
