
**Guy Harris "Doc" White** (April 9, 1879 - February 19, 1969) was an American left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball. He played for two teams, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago White Sox, during his career which lasted from 1901 to 1913. Born in Washington, D.C., "Doc" White was a graduate of a dental school in Georgetown which explains the "Doc" nickname. He led the league in ERA in 1906 with 1.52 and wins in 1907 with 27. White died at age 89 in Silver Spring, Maryland, just 8 months after witnessing Don Drysdale surpass his record of 45 consecutive scoreless innings on June 4, 1968. (From Wikipedia)
