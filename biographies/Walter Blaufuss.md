**Walter Blaufuss** band leader, composer and radio personality and composed the "Breakfast Club Theme" from the Don Mc Neill radio show of the same name that ran on from June 1933 to December of 1968! Before Garrison Keillor and Lake Wobegon, before Oprah, Jay, Rosie, and Dave, there was Don McNeill and his Breakfast Club. Walter Blaufuss was an important part of the show as both the orchestra conductor but also as a regular on the show. In the photo here, Blaufuss is on the right, about to eat a donut handed to him by Annette King while McNeill is in the background. 

Blaufuss' most enduring hit is no doubt *My Isle Of Golden Dreams* from 1919 but he is credited with a number of other great hits from the period including; *Your Eyes Have Told Me So*, 1919 with Egbert Van Alstyne, popularized by John McCormack in the Film, *I'll See You In My Dreams* and who also recorded Blaufuss' *When You're in Love* in 1927. 

As the NBC Musical Conductor for several years, Blaufuss' orchestra also recorded a number of popular and classical works for major record labels including a 1935 recording of Strauss' Blue Danube on Calumet.
