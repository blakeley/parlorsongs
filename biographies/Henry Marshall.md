
**Henry Marshall** and **Stanley Murphy** were a successful songwriting team from the early teens. In addition to this song, they also collaborated to write *Be My Little Baby Bumble Bee*, also in 1912. Alone, Marshal wrote a popular train related song titled *On the 5:15* in 1914. In 1915, Marshal and Murphy again were together for *Loading up The Mandy Lee*, a song that saw a rather short lived success. Murphy also collaborated with Harry Von Tilzer (*They Always Pick On Me*, 1912), Percy Wenrich (*Put On Your Old Gray Bonnet*, 1909) and Albert Von Tilzer with *Oh, How She Could Yacki Hacki Wicki Woo*, in 1915.
