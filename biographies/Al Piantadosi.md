Though many of his wrks were quite popular, unfortunately few have come down to us in the permanent repertoire. During his heydays he collaborated with some of the best lyricists of the times including Alfred Bryan, Grant Clarke, and Edgar Leslie. Piantadosi was a pianist in resorts and night clubs and an accompanist in vaudeville early on. He toured Europe and Australia and was responsible for popularizing much of America's music in those countries. For a time, he owned his own publishing house. Perhaps his most famous work is the tearjerker, *The Curse of An Aching Heart* from 1913. Among his many other popular works are; *Good-Bye Mr Caruso* (1909), *Melinda's Wedding Day* (1913), *Good Luck Mary* (1909) *I Did'nt Raise My Boy To Be A Soldier* (1915), *Rusty-Can-O Rag* (1910), *That Italian Rag* (1910) and *Baby Shoes*, (1916).
