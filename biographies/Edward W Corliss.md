Having written three Broadway shows and several popular songs, it would seem that the available resources would at least mention him however, none in our library so much as mention his name. However, we have found evidence of a number of songs he published and at least one, written for Brown University's Hocky Team in 1895, *Ki-Yi-Yi* (To be sung when the hocky team scores.) From that, I assume he attended Brown around that time. Among his other known songs are; *The Man Behind The Gun* (1899), *Rosalie* (1901), *Katrina* (1902), *Psyche* (1902) and *Life Is Quite Endurable* (1908).
