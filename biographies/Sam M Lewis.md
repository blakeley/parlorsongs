Lewis** (b. 1885, New York, NY, d. 1959, New York, NY ) As with many songwriters, Lewis was a performer first and he sang gigs in nightclubs in New York before song writing took over his life. Lewis was actively writing from 1912 through the 1930's. From 1916 into the 1930's, his principal collaborator was Joe Young, but he did write with some other well known composers including Walter Donaldson, Ted Fiorito and Harry Warren. Sam Lewis and Joe Young were a powerhouse Tin Pan Alley combination. They collaborated only on lyrics but the list of lasting hits for them is astounding. Among their many hits are; *Rockabye Your Baby With A Dixie Melody*, 1918 , music by Jean Schwartz sung by Al Jolson in B'way play *Sinbad*; *Dinah*, with music by Harry Akst, from the Broadway show *Sinbad* starring Al Jolson later, also in *Plantation Revue* starring Ethel Waters; *Five Foot Two, Eyes of Blue*, music by Ray Henderson and *I'm Sitting on Top of the World*, again with Ray Henderson's music (1926). Sam Lewis is a deserved inductee into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame.
