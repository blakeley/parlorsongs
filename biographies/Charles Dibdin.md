**Charles Dibdin** (1745 - 1814) Dibden was a prominent composer and writer born in Dibdin, near Southampton, England. He studied music at Winchester College under Kent and Fussell. He appeared at Richmond and Birmingham as an actor and went to London where in 1765 he was employed by Bickerstaff as a composer and singer. In 1788 renounced the stage and began giving medley monodramas in London. Dibdin, according to his son, wrote over 1300 songs and in addition, wrote the music to accompany his entertainments. Of all his songs, few if any are heard today and only a very few became popularized to the extent that they survived into the early 20th century. Among his most popular works were his musical dramas; *The Shepherd's Artifice*, *Love In The City*, *Damon and Phillida*, and *Padlock*. His literary works include; *Music Epitomized*, a school book in which the science of music is explained and a history of the stage in five volumes. In 1803, Dibdin published an autobiography of his professional life which included the lyrics to over 600 of his songs. At the time, Dibdin was recognized as the most sucessful seafaring and folk song composer. His skill was also recognized by the King of England during the American Revolution who commissioned him to write war songs as propaganda for England. Interestingly, some of those songs also found favor in the colonies. See our April, 2004 issue about Music as Propaganda for one example.
