According to accounts of the time, he was a very versatile man who was an actor, dancer, dance master, playwright and composer. His compositions include songs and piano solo works though a catalog has proven elusive. We have three of his works in our collection, *Bloom & Blossom* a Waltz (1887) and *Autumn Leaf*, a Polka for Children also from 1887 and a part of a six work series for children titled *Shower of Melodies* published by White Smith Music in Boston. His other work we have is a far cry from a childs work and is in fact a complex and fantastic work titled *Dance of The Demon* in 1888. Among his other works are *Marine Band March* and *Battle of Manila* (1898). Holst also composed a comic opera, Our Flats and a comedy, Hot Water. Though we can only find a few of his works listed in various sources, he was quite prolific and a 1907 biography states he produced over two thousand works.
