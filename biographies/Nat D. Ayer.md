Nat D. Ayer (b. 1897, Boston - d. 1952, Bath, England) Ayer wrote a number of lasting and contemporary hits during his time on Tin Pan Alley including *King Chanticleer* (1911, lyrics by Seymour Brown, used in the Ziegfeld Follies) and a huge hit, If You Were The Only Girl In The World in 1916. The music from King Chanticleer is very often performed at ragtime festivals (never the lyrics), - even used as background music in films and accompaniment to silent films. Ayer left "Tin Pan Alley" to return to England, where he remained until the end of his life, composing mostly for the theater. His shows there include *The Bing Boys Are Here* (1916),* The Bing Boys Are There* (1917) and the *Bing Boys On Broadway* (1918) all of which were produced at the Alhambra Theater in London.
Among his other compositions are: *Another Little Drink*, *Bingo Farm*, and *Zuyder Zee*, a popular novelty song:

> Zuyder Zee, Zuyder Zee,
>
> Zuyder Beautiful Zee.

> You unt me, You unt Me,

> Oh How Happy Ve'll Be"
