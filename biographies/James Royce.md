
**James Royce (J. R.) Shannon** (1881 - 1946) Shannon, born James Royce in Adrian, Michigan became one of America's more prominent actor, composer/lyricists of the Tin Pan Alley era. Royce added Shannon to his name to create a pseudonym for his writing efforts. He organized his own theatrical company and toured the US and Europe. Shannon also was the drama critic for the Detroit Free Press for several years. His most famous song is *Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral*, written in 1913 for the musical production *Shameen Dhu* which was staged in New York in 1914. He also wrote the lyrics to *The Missouri Waltz* in 1916. That song had originally been published by the composer, Frederick Knight Logan in 1914 as a waltz without words. Shannon added the words and the song has since enjoyed the status of a lasting hit, becoming the state song of Missouri and also as a song regularly played by president Harry Truman in the White House.
