
**Hans Engelmann** wrote a number of works that were for children and several other works, one of which has remained in the popular repertoire for a century, his *Melody of Love* from 1903 which we featured way back in '98. In addition, we have several other works by him; *Day Dreams* (1901), *Rosebud Schottische* (1898), *Dolly Varden*, a Sunday newpaper supplement from 1903, an arrangement of Gounod's *Flower Song* from 1902 and *Rose of Normandy* (1906). In addition, we are aware of at least one march he wrote that is in the current marching band repertoire; *Philadelphia Record* (1902). In spite of what is clearly a large catalog of works (*The Little Hostess* is marked as Op. 556), I can find little to no other information about him which really is quite puzzling.
