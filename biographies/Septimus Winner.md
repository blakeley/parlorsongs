**Septimus Winner** (1827 - 1902) Winner was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the seventh child to Joseph E. Winner (an instrument maker specializing in violins) and wife Mary Ann. Mary Ann Winner was a relative of Nathaniel Hawthorne, hence Septimus' use of the Hawthorne name as part of his pseudonym Alice Hawthorne. He also used other pseudonymns during his career, including Mark Mason, Percy Guyer, and Paul Stenton.
Winner attended Philadelphia Central High School. Although largely self-taught in the area of music, he did take lessons from Leopold Meignen around 1853, but by that time he was already an established instrumental teacher, and performed locally with various ensembles. From around 1845 to 1854, Septimus Winner partnered with his brother Joseph Eastburn Winner (1837 - 1918) as music publishers. Septimus continued in the business with various partners and names up until 1902.
Winner was especially popular for his ballads published under the pseudonym of Alice Hawthorne, which became known generically as "Hawthorne's Ballads". His brother was also a composer, publishing under the alias Eastburn. Septimus Winner was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1970.
In addition to composing popular songs, Winner also produced more than 200 instruction method books for more than twenty-three instruments. He wrote more than 1,500 easy arrangements for various instruments and almost 2,000 arrangements for violin and piano. The most popular Septimus Winner songs include: *How Sweet Are the Roses* (1850), *I Set My Heart Upon a Flower* (1854), *What Is Home Without a Mother* (1854), *Listen to the Mockingbird* (1855), *Abraham's Daughter or *Raw Recruits* (1861), *Der Deitcher's Dog* (1864), *Ellie Rhee or Carry Me Back to Tennessee* (1865), *What Care I?* (1866), *Whispering Hope* (1868), *Ten Little Indians* (originally "Ten Little Niggers") (1868), *Come Where the Woodbine Twineth* (1870) and *Love Once Gone Is Lost Forever* (1870) (From Wikipedia)
