The first composer to be knighted by Queen Victoria in 1842, Bishop was highly regarded as a composer particularly of songs and opera. In spite of the enormous list of his stage works, that includes no fewer than eight pieces based on Sir W. Scott and at least seventeen Operas, his output contains little of interest or that is performed today save that one simple song from his Opera Clari; the song Home, Sweet Home.

Born in London, Bishop began composing at a very early age and studied under the noted Cremonese composer Francesco Bianchi (1752 - 1810). At the age of only eighteen he wrote the music to the stage work *Angelina* (1804) and later, for the ballet *Tamerlan et Bajazet*. His three act opera, *The Circassian Bride* (1809) produced at the Drury Lane Theater is the work that first brought Bishop into critical and popular notice. A tragic footnote to history regarding *The Circassian Bride* is that the night after it's first performance, the theater was destroyed in a fire and Bishop's only score for the work was lost in the fire. So strong was the reception to that one performance though that Bishop's work was acclaimed and in 1810, he was offered the prestigious position of musical director of Covent Garden. During his thirteen year tenure at Covent Garden, he produced many operas including *The Lady of the Lake*, *Guy Mannering*, and *The Slave*.

In 1813, Bishop founded the Philharmonic Society and acted as conductor for a period of two years during which he produced a number of oratorios and other works. In 1825 he returned to opera and to the rebuilt Drury Lane Theater. In 1839 he was appointed musical director at Vauxhall Gardens and later, in 1840 & 41, he returned to Covent Garden as director. 

In 1840, his last dramatic piece, *The Fortunate Isles*, was produced at Covent Garden in honor of the queen's (Victoria) wedding. No stranger to academia, Bishop also served as professor of music at Edinburgh University from 1841 to 1843 and in 1848 he became professor of music at Oxford. In 1842, he was knighted by Victoria, the first composer to receive this honor.

During his long career, Bishop produced over one hundred and twenty-five operas, operettas, ballets and other musical works. More than two thirds of his output was entirely his own the others being adaptations or collaborations with other composers or librettists. Unfortunately, it seems few if any of these works save Home Sweet Home have survived to be found in the modern repertory.
