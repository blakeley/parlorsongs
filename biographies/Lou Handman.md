
**Lou Handman** (1894 - 1956) Born in New York in 1894, Handman came of age touring in vaudeville and playing piano for soldier shows in the First World War. He then hit Tin Pan Alley, where he was a song plugger for Irving Berlin and an accompanist to vaudeville star Marion Harris. Shortly thereafter, he began writing his own songs, creating a string of hits that would be sung and performed by the most important radio and recording artists of the time. Songs like *Me and the Moon*, *No Nothing*, *Was it Rain*, *Blue and Broken Hearted*, and his biggest hit *Are You Lonesome Tonight?* filled the airwaves and the dance halls of the era.
